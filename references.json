The addition of the finite disk factor reduces the line force near the star and increases it far from the star, which lowers the mass-loss rate, increases the terminal velocity, and makes the velocity law more gradual. These changes bring the wind model into much closer agreement with observations of hot star winds. In particular, the decrease in the ratio of terminal velocity to escape velocity in the B sugergiants can now be explained as due to a change in the mixture of driving lines. Including a centrifugal force (in the equatorial plane) decreases the terminal velocity and increases the massloss rate, but neither effect is measurable in current data.",

		"abstract": "We present high-resolution infrared (2–18 μm) images of the archetypal periodic dust-making Wolf–Rayet binary system WR 140 (HD 193793) taken between 2001 and 2005, and multicolour (J – [19.5]) photometry observed between 1989 and 2001. The images resolve the dust cloud formed by WR 140 in 2001, allowing us to track its expansion and cooling, while the photometry allows tracking the average temperature and total mass of the dust. The combination of the two data sets constrains the optical properties of the dust, and suggests that they differ from those of the dust made by the WC9 dust-makers, including the classical ‘pinwheel’, WR 104. The photometry of individual dust emission features shows them to be signiﬁcantly redder in (nbL –[3.99]), but bluer in ([7.9]–[12.5]), than the binary, as expected from the spectra of heated dust and the stellar wind of a Wolf–Rayet star. The most persistent dust features, two concentrations at the ends of a ‘bar’ of emission to the south of the star, were observed to move with constant proper motions of 324 ± 8 and 243 ± 7 mas yr−1. Longer wavelength (4.68 and 12.5 μm) images show dust emission from the corresponding features from the previous (1993) periastron passage and dust formation episode, showing that the dust expanded freely in a low-density void for over a decade, with dust features repeating from one cycle to the next. A third persistent dust concentration to the east of the binary (the ‘arm’) was found to have a proper motion ∼320 mas yr−1, and a dust mass about one-quarter that of the ‘bar’. Extrapolation of the motions of the concentrations back to the binary suggests that the eastern ‘arm’ began expansion four to ﬁve months earlier than those in the southern ‘bar’, consistent with the projected rotation of the binary axis and wind-collision region (WCR) on the sky. A comparison of model dust images and the observations constrains the intervals when the WCR was producing sufﬁciently compressed wind for dust nucleation in the WCR, and suggests that the distribution of this material was not uniform about the axis of the WCR, but more abundant in the following edge in the orbital plane.",

		"abstract": "In this thesis, a three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) program has been described, made parallel, tested and applied to astrophysical problems. The program, named CUBEMPI, was made parallel using the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) library and examined via simple efficiency tests and more complex performance profilers within the Multi-Processing Environment (MPE) library of MPI. CUBEMPI was tested with various hydrodynamical problems, CUBEMPI successfully completed all tests and its performance was compared with that of several other CFD schemes. Comparing CUBEMPI with these other schemes, no one scheme performed consistently better than any of the others, CUBEMPI efficiently computes accurate solutions to the Euler equations and thus can be used to simulate fluid flow. CUBEMPI has been shown to be particularly capable of simulating shocks in astrophysical conditions and so was used to consider planetary nebulae (PNe) and their interaction with the interstellar medium (ISM). Previous modelling of PNe moving through the ISM has been performed in two dimensions (2D) following a detailed evolutionary track of the PN-forming star moving at a low speed. Here CUBEMPI has been used to simulate the interaction in three dimensions (3D) with a range of proper motions using a generic simple \"triple-wind\" model for the formation of PNe. This modelling has considered the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and post-AGB stages of evolution and led to the conclusion that to understand the shape of a nebula inferred to be moving through the ISM, the AGB evolution must be considered as well as the post-AGB evolution as it has a strong shaping effect on the nebula. Signs of PN-ISM interaction are found not to be confined to ancient or extreme nebulae. In this thesis, simulated younger nebulae moving at low speeds show one-sided brightening and displacement of the central star from the geometric centre of the nebula. At higher speeds the nebulae are strongly affected and eventually no longer appear symmetric. The effect of ISM shaping on nebulae has been quantitatively shown in this thesis to be an explanation for the missing mass problem in PNe; much of the AGB material is swept downstream of the nebula. New observations of the crescent shaped nebula Sh 2-188 have been compared to the PN-ISM simulations and the nebula has been understood in terms of a PN moving at 125 kms[-1]. A proper motion study of the nebula has found it to be moving at 30 ± 10 masyr[-1] in the direction of the bright crescent. The combination of these values has led to an estimate of the distance D = 850[+500-420] pc, diameter d ~ 2.5 pc and age t[PN] = 22,500 ± 2,500 years. The triple-wind model explains the geometric displacement of the central star and the simulation estimates ~ 2/3 of the mass expected in the region of the star has been swept downstream. The nebula surrounding the classical nova GK Persei has also been investigated in terms of the triple-wind model using an asymmetric AGB wind. The model has produced a bipolar nebula of the shape observed around GK Per and high density equatorial regions which could account for the brightened emission in the southwest of the nova. Finally, improvements of CUBEMPI and the models are suggested.",

In this ﬁrst paper, we restrict our study to main-sequence O+O binaries. The nature of the wind–wind collision region is highly dependent on the degree of cooling of the shocked plasma, and the ratio of the ﬂow time-scale of the shocked plasma to the orbital time-scale. The pre-shock wind speeds are lower in close systems as the winds collide prior to their acceleration to terminal speeds. Radiative inhibition may also reduce the pre-shock wind speeds. Together, these effects can lead to rapid cooling of the post-shock gas. Radiative inhibition is less important in wider systems, where the winds are accelerated to higher speeds before they collide, and the resulting collision region can be largely adiabatic. In systems with eccentric orbits, cold gas formed during periastron passage can persist even at apastron, before being ablated and mixed into its surroundings and/or accelerated out of the system.",

The calculations are based on 3D hydrodynamical models which incorporate gravity, the driving of the winds, orbital motion of the stars and radiative cooling of the shocked plasma. The thermal emission arises from the stellar winds and the region where they collide. We investigate the ﬂux and spectrum from a variety of models as a function of orbital phase and orientation of the observer, and compare to the single star case. The emission from the wind–wind collision region (WCR) is strongly dependent on its density and temperature, being optically thick in radiative systems and optically thin in adiabatic systems. The ﬂux from systems where the WCR is highly radiative, as investigated for the ﬁrst time in this paper, can be over an order of magnitude greater than the combined ﬂux from identically typed single stars. This excess occurs over a broad range of wavelengths from cm to submm. In contrast, when the WCR is largely adiabatic, a signiﬁcant excess in the thermal ﬂux occurs only below 100 GHz.",

The models are based on the three-dimensional radiative-transfer code TORUS, modiﬁed to include an adaptive mesh that allows us to adequately resolve both the inner spiral turns (subau scales) and the outer regions of the nebula (distances of 104 au from the central source). The spiral model provides a good ﬁt to both the spectral energy distribution and Keck aperture masking interferometry, reproducing both the maximum entropy recovered images and the visibility curves. We deduce a dust creation rate of 8 ± 1 × 10−7 M yr−1, corresponding to approximately 2 per cent by mass of the carbon produced by the Wolf–Rayet star. Simultaneous modelling of the imaging and spectral data enables us to constrain both the opening angle of the wind–wind collision interface and the dust grain size. We conclude that the dust grains in the inner part of the Pinwheel Nebula are small (∼100 Å), in agreement with theoretical predictions, although we cannot rule out the presence of larger grains (∼1 µm) further from the central binary. The opening angle of the wind–wind collision interface appears to be about 40◦, in broad agreement with the wind parameters estimated for the central binary. We discuss the success and deﬁciencies of the model, and the likely beneﬁts of applying similar techniques to the more complex nebulae observed around other WR/O star binaries.",

		"abstract": "Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are luminous massive blue stars thought to be immediate precursors to the supernova terminating their brief lives. The existence of dust shells around such stars has been enigmatic since their discovery some 30 years ago; the intense radiation field from the star should be inimical to dust survival. Although dust-creation models, including those involving interacting stellar winds from a companion star, have been put forward, high-resolution observations are required to understand this phenomena. Here we present resolved images of the dust outflow around Wolf-Rayet WR 104, obtained with novel imaging techniques, revealing detail on scales corresponding to about 40 AU at the star. Our maps show that the dust forms a spatially confined stream following precisely a linear (or Archimedian) spiral trajectory. Images taken at two separate epochs show a clear rotation with a period of 220 +/- 30 days. Taken together, these findings prove that a binary star is responsible for the creation of the circumstellar dust, while the spiral plume makes WR 104 the prototype of a new class of circumstellar nebulae unique to interacting wind systems.",

Encompassing 11 epochs in three near-infrared filter bandpasses, a homogeneous imaging data set spanning more than 6 years (or 10 orbits) is presented. Data were obtained from the highly successful Keck Aperture Masking Experiment, which can recover high fidelity images at extremely high angular resolutions, revealing the geometry of the plume with unprecedented precision. Inferred properties for the (unresolved) underlying binary and wind system are orbital period 241.5 +/- 0.5 days and angular outflow velocity of 0.28 +/- 0.02 mas/day. An optically thin cavity of angular size 13.3 +/- 1.4 mas was found to lie between the central binary and the onset of the spiral dust plume. Rotational motion of the wind system induced by the binary orbit is found to have important ramifications: entanglement of the winds results in strong shock activity far downstream from the nose of the bowshock. The far greater fraction of the winds participating in the collision may play a key role in gas compression and the nucleation of dust at large radii from the central binary and shock stagnation point. Investigation of the effects of radiative braking pointed towards significant modifications of the simple hydrostatic colliding wind geometry, extending the relevance of this phenomena to wider binary systems than previously considered. Limits placed on the maximum allowed orbital eccentricity of e < 0.06 argue strongly for a prehistory of tidal circularization in this system. Finally we discuss the implications of Earth's polar (i < 16 deg) vantage point onto a system likely to host supernova explosions at future epochs.",

		"abstract": "Hot, massive stars have strong stellar winds, and in hot-star binaries these winds can undergo violent collision. Because such winds are thought to be radiatively driven, radiative forces may also play an important role in moderating the wind collision. However, previous studies have been limited to considering how such forces may inhibit the initial acceleration of the companion stellar wind. In this paper we analyze the role of an even stronger radiative braking effect, whereby the primary wind is rather suddenly decelerated by the radiative momentum flux it encounters as it approaches a bright companion. We further show that the braking location and velocity law along the line of centers between the stars can be approximated analytically using a simple one-dimensional analysis. The results of this analysis agree well with a detailed two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of the wind collision in the WR + O binary V444 Cygni and demonstrate that radiative braking can significantly alter the bow-shock geometry and reduce the strength of the wind collision. We then apply the derived analytic theory to a set of 14 hot-star binary systems, and conclude that radiative braking is likely to be of widespread importance for wind-wind collisions in WR + O binaries with close to medium separation, D ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] lesssim 100 R ☉ . It may also be important in other types of hot-star binaries that exhibit a large imbalance between the component wind strengths.",

		"abstract": "The Wolf–Rayet 98a (WR 98a) system is a prime target for interferometric surveys, since its identiﬁcation as a ‘rotating pinwheel nebulae’, where infrared images display a spiral dust lane revolving with a 1.4 yr periodicity. WR 98a hosts a WC9+OB star, and the presence of dust is puzzling given the extreme luminosities of Wolf–Rayet stars. We present 3D hydrodynamic models for WR 98a, where dust creation and redistribution are self-consistently incorporated. Our grid-adaptive simulations resolve details in the wind collision region at scales below one percent of the orbital separation (∼4 au), while simulating up to 1300 au. We cover several orbital periods under conditions where the gas component alone behaves adiabatic, or is subject to effective radiative cooling. In the adiabatic case, mixing between stellar winds is effective in a well-deﬁned spiral pattern, where optimal conditions for dust creation are met. When radiative cooling is incorporated, the interaction gets dominated by thermal instabilities along the wind collision region, and dust concentrates in clumps and ﬁlaments in a volume-ﬁlling fashion, so WR 98a must obey close to adiabatic evolutions to demonstrate the rotating pinwheel structure. We mimic Keck, ALMA or future E-ELT observations and confront photometric long-term monitoring. We predict an asymmetry in the dust distribution between leading and trailing edge of the spiral, show that ALMA and E-ELT would be able to detect ﬁne-structure in the spiral indicative of Kelvin–Helmholtz development, and conﬁrm the variation in photometry due to the orientation. Historic Keck images are reproduced, but their resolution is insufﬁcient to detect the details we predict.",

		"abstract": "The large number of subordinate lines of a representative ion are found to have a dominant effect on the force of radiation on material in O star atmospheres. The force is increased over that due to resonance lines alone so that rates of mass loss are obtained which are 100 times greater than previously thought possible. The force is related to the solution of the line-transfer problem, and it becomes a function of the local velocity gradient. A new stellar wind theory, with a different interpretation of the singular point, is developed to treat this situation. The rate of mass loss, and other properties of the model, are uniquely specified by the luminosity, mass, and radius of the star. Alternative static models do not exist. Numerical results give a rate of mass loss 6 x 10“6 221© per year for an 05 star, with a terminal velocity of 1500 km s“1. The rate of mass loss is sensitive to stellar parameters, while the terminal velocity is not. The continuum optical depth in the expanding envelope is about 0.16, of the right order to explain the reduced brightness temperature observed in £ Pup. There is sufficient mass in the envelope for recombination to produce the emission lines of H and of He n which are observed, with approximately the proper strength. The rate of mass loss corresponds to a loss of more than 25 percent of the star’s mass during main-sequence hydrogen burning, with obvious consequences for stellar evolution, and with the possibility of modified surface abundances.",

Here we report the discovery of a relatively cool, extended, multi-arc dust envelope around the star WR112, most likely formed by wind-wind collision in a long-period binary system. We derive the binary orbital parameters, the dust temperature and the dust mass distributions in the envelope. We ﬁnd that amorphous carbon is a main constituent of the dust, in agreement with earlier estimates and theoretical predictions. However, the characteristic size of the dust grains is estimated to be ∼ 1µm, signiﬁcantly larger than theoretical limits. The dust production rate is 6.1 × 10−7M⊙yr−1 and the total detectable dust mass is found to be about 2.8 × 10−5M⊙ (for d = 4.15 kpc). We also show that, despite the hostile environment, at least ∼20% of the initially-formed dust may reach the interstellar medium.",

We attribute an absorption feature at 6.2 mm in the spectra of WC stars to amorphous carbon dust. This absorption feature is not detected in the diffuse interstellar medium toward the WR 147, Cyg OB2 No. 12, or the Pistol Star, and therefore we suggest that it is circumstellar in nature. In addition, we detect a broad absorption feature extending from approximately 6.5 to 8 mm. We tentatively attribute this absorption to the C i C stretching modes that accompany the 6.2 mm band in aromatic materials. Our analysis of the 6.2 mm absorption proﬁle suggests that the dust grains have to be rather large (∼1 mm) and point toward dense clumps as the sites of dust formation.",

We show that the ultraviolet resonance lines of ions such as Si iv, C iv, N v, and S vi can give strongly negative effective gravities in the outer parts of the reversing layers of hot stars. We argue that a static reversing layer is then no longer possible and that a continuous outflow of mass occurs. To calculate rates of mass loss resulting from this mechanism, we formulate the problem of steady-state, moving reversing layers. From numerical solutions of the equations of this problem, the rate of mass loss is found to be < L/c2\\ the evolution of the star is therefore not disturbed significantly. The domain in the (log Teiii log g)-plane where the greatest rates of mass loss are expected is also approximately determined and found to be roughly consistent with observation. Finally, the problem of the supersonic flow to large distances from the star is briefly discussed.",

We connect stellar structure models for He stars with wind models for optically-thick winds and assess how both types of models can simultaneously fulﬁll their respective sonic-point conditions.\nResults. Fixing the outer wind law and terminal wind velocity ∞, we obtain unique solutions for the mass-loss rates of opticallythick, radiatively-driven winds of WR stars in the phase of core He-burning. The resulting mass-loss relations as a function of stellar parameters, agree well with previous empirical relations. Furthermore, we encounter stellar mass limits below which no continuous solutions exist. While these mass limits agree with observations of WR stars in the Galaxy, they are in conﬂict with observations in the LMC.\nConclusions. While our results conﬁrm in particular the slope of oft-used empirical mass-loss relations, they imply that only part of the observed WN population can be understood in the framework of the standard assumptions of a smooth transonic ﬂow and compact stellar core. This means that alternative approaches, such as a clumped and inﬂated wind structure, or deviations from the diﬀusion limit at the sonic point may have to be invoked. Qualitatively, the existence of mass limits for the formation of WR-type winds may be relevant for the non-detection of low-mass WR stars in binary systems, which are believed to be progenitors of Type Ib/c supernovae. The sonic-point conditions derived in this work may provide a possibility to include optically-thick winds in stellar evolution models in a more physically motivated form than in current models.",

The observed distributions of nitrogen- (WN) and carbon (WC)-sequence WR stars in the Milky Way and in nearby star-forming galaxies are discussed; these imply lower limits to progenitor masses of ∼25, 40, and 75 M for hydrogen-depleted (He-burning) WN, WC, and H-rich (Hburning) WN stars, respectively. WR stars in massive star binaries permit studies of wind-wind interactions and dust formation in WC systems. They also show that WR stars have typical masses of 10–25 M , extending up to 80 M for H-rich WN stars. Theoretical and observational evidence that WR winds depend on metallicity is presented, with implications for evolutionary models, ionizing ﬂuxes, and the role of WR stars within the context of core-collapse supernovae and long-duration gamma-ray bursts.",

Because the chemical pathways leading to the formation of interstellar hydrides are relatively simple, the analysis of the observed abundances is relatively straightforward and provides key information about the environments where hydrides are found. Recent years have seen rapid progress in our understanding of interstellar hydrides, thanks largely to FIR and submillimeter observations performed with the Herschel Space Observatory.

I overview the current landscape of modern gridbased numerical techniques with an emphasis on numerical diffusion, which plays a fundamental role in stabilizing the solution but is also the main source of errors associated with these numerical techniques. I discuss in great detail the inclusion of additional important source terms, such as cooling and gravity. I also show how to modify classic operator-splitting techniques to avoid undesirable numerical errors associated with these additional source terms, in particular in the presence of highly supersonic ﬂows. I ﬁnally present various mesh adaptation strategies that can be used to minimize these numerical errors. To conclude, I review existing astrophysical software that is publicly available to perform simulations for such astrophysical ﬂuids.",

We show that when simulating such mixtures with particles or with particles coupled to grids a problem arises due to the need to resolve a very small length scale when the coupling is strong. Since this is occurs in the limit when the ﬂuids are well coupled, we show how the dust-gas equations can be reformulated to describe a single ﬂuid mixture. The equations are similar to the usual ﬂuid equations supplemented by a diﬀusion equation for the dust-to-gas ratio or alternatively the dust fraction. This solves a number of numerical problems as well as making the physics clear.",

The solutions provide a means of benchmarking numerical codes designed to simulate the non-linear dynamics of dusty gas. The ﬁrst problem, DUSTYBOX, consists of two interpenetrating homogeneous ﬂuids moving with relative velocity difference. We provide exact solutions to the full non-linear problem for a range of drag formulations appropriate to astrophysical ﬂuids (i.e. various prescriptions for Epstein and Stokes drag in different regimes). The second problem, DUSTYWAVE, consists of the propagation of linear acoustic waves in a two-ﬂuid gas–dust mixture. We provide the analytic solution for the case when the two ﬂuids are interacting via a linear drag term. Both test problems are simple to set up in any numerical code and can be run with periodic boundary conditions. The solutions we derive are completely general with respect to both the dust-to-gas ratio and the amplitude of the drag coefﬁcient. A stability analysis of waves in a gas–dust system is also presented, showing that sound waves in an astrophysical dust–gas mixture are linearly stable.",

		"abstract": "In this paper, we show how the two-ﬂuid equations describing the evolution of a dust and gas mixture can be re-formulated to describe a single ﬂuid moving with the barycentric velocity of the mixture. This leads to evolution equations for the total density, momentum, the differential velocity between the dust and the gas phases and either the dust-to-gas ratio or the dust fraction. The equations are similar to the usual equations of gas dynamics, providing a convenient way to extend existing codes to simulate two-ﬂuid mixtures without modifying the code architecture. Our approach avoids the inherent difﬁculties related to the standard approach where the two phases are separate and coupled via a drag term. In particular, the requirements of inﬁnite spatial and temporal resolution as the stopping time tends to zero are no longer necessary. This means that both small and large grains can be straightforwardly treated with the same method, with no need for complicated implicit schemes. Since there is only one resolution scale the method also avoids the problem of unphysical trapping of one ﬂuid (e.g. dust) below the resolution of the other. We also derive a simpliﬁed set of equations applicable to the case of strong drag/small grains, consisting of the standard ﬂuid equations with a modiﬁed sound speed, plus an advection–diffusion equation for the dust-to-gas ratio. This provides a simple and fast way to evolve the mixture when the stopping time is smaller than the Courant time step. We present a smoothed particle hydrodynamics implementation in a companion paper.",

		"abstract": "Following the observational and theoretical evidence that points at core collapse supernovae as major producers of dust, here we calculate the hydrodynamics of the matter reinserted within young and massive super stellar clusters under the assumption of gas and dust radiative cooling. The large supernova rate expected in massive clusters allows for a continuous replenishment of dust immersed in the high temperature thermalized reinserted matter and warrants a stationary presence of dust within the cluster volume during the type II supernova era. We ﬁrst show that such a balance determines the range of dust to gas mass ratio and this the dust cooling law. We then search for the critical line that separates stationary cluster winds from the bimodal cases in the cluster mechanical luminosity (or cluster mass) vs cluster size parameter space. In the latter, strong radiative cooling reduces considerably the cluster wind mechanical energy output and aﬀects particularly the cluster central regions, leading to frequent thermal instabilities that diminish the pressure and inhibit the exit of the reinserted matter. Instead matter accumulates there and is expected to eventually lead to gravitational instabilities and to further stellar formation with the matter reinserted by former massive stars. The main outcome of the calculations is that the critical line is almost two orders of magnitude or more, depending on the assumed value of VA∞, lower than when only gas radiative cooling is applied. And thus, many massive clusters are predicted to enter the bimodal regime.",

The corresponding continuum radiative transfer problem is described, and the numerical requirements for inverse 3D density and temperature modeling are deﬁned. We introduce a relative intensity and transform the radiative transfer equation along the rays to solve machine precision problems and to relax strong gradients in the source term. For the optically thick regions where common ray tracers are forced to perform small trace steps, we give two criteria for making use of a simple approximative solver crossing the optically thick region quickly. Using an example of a density structure with optical depth changes of 6 orders of magnitude and sharp temperature variations, we demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed scheme using a common ﬁfth-order Runge-Kutta ray tracer with adaptive step-size control. In our test case, the gain in computational speed is about a factor of 870. The method is applied in order to calculate the temperature distribution within a massive molecular cloud core for different boundary conditions for the radiation ﬁeld.",

We tested the updated code with benchmark models where the dust self-heating is not negligible. Furthermore, we performed a study of the extent of the source inﬂuence volumes, using galaxy models, which are critical in determining the eﬃciency of the DART-Ray algorithm. The new code is publicly available, documented for both users and developers, and accompanied by several programmes to create input grids for diﬀerent model geometries and to import the results of N-body and SPH simulations.

To calculate the synchrotron emission several simplifying assumptions are adopted: the relativistic particle energy density is a simple fraction of the thermal particle energy density, in equipartition with the magnetic energy density, and a power-law in energy. We also assume that the magnetic ﬁeld is tangled such that the resulting emission is isotropic. The applicability of these calculations to modelling radio images and spectra of colliding-wind systems is demonstrated with models of the radio emission from the wide WR+OB binary WR 147. Its synchrotron spectrum follows a power-law between 5 and 15 GHz but turns down to below this at lower and higher frequencies. We ﬁnd that while free-free opacity from the circum-binary stellar winds can potentially account for the low-frequency turnover, models that also include a combination of synchrotron self-absorption and Razin eﬀect are favoured. We argue that the highfrequency turn down is a consequence of inverse-Compton cooling. We present our resulting spectra and intensity distributions, along with simulated MERLIN observations of these intensity distributions. From these we argue that the inclination of the WR 147 system to the plane of the sky is low. We summarise by considering extensions of the current model that are important for models of the emission from closer colliding wind binaries, in particular the dramatically varying radio emission of WR 140.",

		"abstract": "Cosmic dust is present in many astrophysical objects, and recent observations across the electromagnetic spectrum show that the dust distribution is often strongly three-dimensional (3D). Dust grains are effective in absorbing and scattering ultraviolet (UV)/optical radiation, and they re-emit the absorbed energy at infrared wavelengths. Understanding the intrinsic properties of these objects, including the dust itself, therefore requires 3D dust radiative transfer (RT) calculations. Unfortunately, the 3D dust RT problem is nonlocal and nonlinear, which makes it one of the hardest challenges in computational astrophysics. Nevertheless, signiﬁcant progress has been made in the past decade, with an increasing number of codes capable of dealing with the complete 3D dust RT problem. We discuss the complexity of this problem, the two most successful solution techniques [ray-tracing (RayT) and Monte Carlo (MC)], and the state of the art in modeling observational data using 3D dust RT codes. We end with an outlook on the bright future of this ﬁeld.",

		"abstract": "A combined mid-IR spectrum of ﬁve colliding-wind, massive, dust-producing Population I Wolf-Rayet (WR) binaries shows a wealth of absorption and emission details coming from the circumstellar dust envelopes, as well as from the interstellar medium. The prominent absorption features may arise from a mix of interstellar carbonaceous grains formed in high- (e.g., 3.4, 6.8, 7.2 µm ) and low-temperature (3.3, 6.9, 9.3 µm ) environments. The broad emission complexes around ∼6.5, 8.0 and 8.8 µm could arise from ionized, small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) clusters and/or amorphous carbonaceous grains. As such these PAH emissions may represent the long sought after precursors of amorphous Carbon dust. We also detect a strong ∼10.0 µm emission in the spectra of WR48a and WR112, that we tentatively link to ionized PAHs. Upon examining the available archival spectra of prodigious individual WR dust sources, we notice a surprising lack of 7.7 µm PAH band in the spectrum of the binary WR19, in contrast to the apparent strength of the 11.2, 12.7 and 16.4 µm PAH features. Strong PAH emissions are also detected in the λ >10 µm spectrum of another dust-producing system, WR118, pointing to the presence of large, neutral, presumably interstellar PAH molecules towards WR19 and WR118.",

Data for a comparable number of dust-free WC6–9 stars were also examined to help characterize the data set. Frequent eclipses were observed from WR 104, and several from WR 106, extending the 1994–2001 studies by Kato et al., but not supporting their phasing the variations in WR 104 with its ‘pinwheel’ rotation period. Only four other stars showed eclipses, WR 50 (one of the dust-free stars), WR 69, WR 95 and WR 117, and there may have been an eclipse by WR 121, which had shown two eclipses in the past. No dust eclipses were shown by the ‘historic’ eclipsers WR 103 and WR 113. The atmospheric eclipses of the latter were observed but the suggestion by David-Uraz et al. that dust may be partly responsible for these is not supported. Despite its frequent eclipses, there is no evidence in the infrared images of WR 104 for dust made in its eclipses, demonstrating that any dust formed in this process is not a signiﬁcant contributor to its circumstellar dust cloud and suggesting that the same applies to the other stars showing fewer eclipses.",

		"abstract": "Radiative shocks perturbed from steady state are subject to an oscillatory overstability. We have examined the nature of this\noverstability in one and two dimensions using numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We find that one-dimensional simulations of a uniform flow incident upon a reflecting wall produce oscillation frequencies in agreement with those of earlier analytic (Chevalier & Imamura 1982) and numerical (Imamura, Wolff, & Durisen 1984) work. We do not,\nhowever, find any evidence for positive growth rates. This result is not in contradiction with previous linear analysis because the supersonic flow into a wall problem is at a saturated, nonlinear amplitude from the beginning. In the case of one-dimensional steady state shocks in the absence of a solid wall, we find a slightly different dependence of the overstability on α when we assume a cooling rate proportional to Tα. In this case oscillations in radiative shocks with α ≲ 0.75 are found to saturate at a finite amplitude, i.e.,\nthe relevant critical value of alpha is at least above 0.5. We also find high Mach number systems to be less stable than low Mach number systems subject to the same cooling law. Simulations of two-dimensional steady state shocks reveal that transverse perturbations in the shock front quickly manifest themselves in the cold, dense gas layer downstream of the cooling region. Perturbations in the cold gas layer are dominated by spatial wavelengths, λ ≲ Lc, the cooling\nlength of the shock. The action of this instability ensures that interstellar radiative shocks will not be smooth on length scales of order the local cooling length.",

We simulate the interaction of the mechanical energy input from 15, 40, 60 and 120 M stars into a 100 pc diameter 16 500 M cloud with a roughly spherical morphology with randomly distributed high-density condensations. The stellar winds are introduced using appropriate non-rotating Geneva stellar evolution models. In the 15 M star case, the wind has very little effect, spreading around a few neighbouring clumps before becoming overwhelmed by the cloud collapse. In contrast, in the 40, 60 and 120 M star cases, the more powerful stellar winds create large cavities and carve channels through the cloud, breaking out into the surrounding tenuous medium during the wind phase and considerably altering the cloud structure. After 4.97, 3.97 and 3.01 Myr, respectively, the massive stars explode as supernovae (SNe). The wind-sculpted surroundings considerably affect the evolution of these SN events as they both escape the cloud along wind-carved channels and sweep up remaining clumps of cloud/wind material. The ‘cloud’ as a coherent structure does not survive the SN from any of these stars, but only in the 120 M case is the cold molecular material completely destabilized and returned to the unstable thermal phase. In the 40 and 60 M cases, coherent clumps of cold material are ejected from the cloud by the SN, potentially capable of further star formation.",

		"abstract": "We study the chemical evolution of interstellar grain mantle by varying the physical parameters of the interstellar medium (ISM). To mimic the exact interstellar condition, gas grain interactions via accretion from the gas phase and desorption (thermal evaporation and photo-evaporation) from the grain surface are considered. We ﬁnd that the chemical composition of the interstellar grain mantle is highly dependent on the physical parameters associated with a molecular cloud. Interstellar photons are seen to play an important role towards the growth and the structure of the interstellar grain mantle. We consider the eﬀects of interstellar photons (photo-dissociation and photo-evaporation) in our simulation under various interstellar conditions. We notice that the eﬀects of interstellar photons dominate around the region of lower visual extinction. These photons contribute signiﬁcantly in the formation of the grain mantle. Energy of the incoming photon is attenuated by the absorption and scattering by the interstellar dust. Top most layers are mainly assumed to be aﬀected by the incoming radiation. We have studied the eﬀects of photo-dissociation by varying the number of layers which could be aﬀected by it. Model calculations are carried out for the static (extinction parameter is changing with the density of the cloud) as well as the time dependent case (i.e., extinction parameter and number density of the cloud both are changing with time) and the results are discussed in details. Diﬀerent routes to the formation of water molecules are studied and it is noticed that around the dense region, production of water molecules via O3 and H2O2 contributes signiﬁcantly. At the end, various observational evidences for the condensed phase species are summarized with their physical conditions and are compared with our simulation results.",

		"abstract": "We present theoretical X-ray line proﬁles from a range of model colliding wind systems. In particular, we investigate the effects of varying the stellar mass-loss rates, the wind speeds and the viewing orientation. We ﬁnd that a wide range of theoretical line proﬁle shapes is possible, varying with orbital inclination and phase. At or near conjunction, the lines have approximately Gaussian proﬁles, with small widths (HWHM ∼ 0.1v∞) and deﬁnite blueshifts or redshifts (depending on whether the star with the weaker wind is in front or behind). When the system is viewed at quadrature, the lines are generally much broader (HWHM ∼ v∞), ﬂat-topped and unshifted. Local absorption can have a major effect on the observed proﬁles – in systems with mass-loss rates of a few times 10−6 M yr−1 the lower energy lines (E 1 keV) are particularly affected. This generally results in blueward-skewed proﬁles, especially when the system is viewed through the dense wind of the primary. The orbital variation of the linewidths and shifts is reduced in a low-inclination binary. The extreme case is a binary with i = 0◦, for which we would expect no line proﬁle variation.",

		"abstract": "We present DART-RAY, a new ray-tracing 3D dust radiative transfer (RT) code designed speciﬁcally to calculate radiation ﬁeld energy density (RFED) distributions within dusty galaxy models with arbitrary geometries. In this paper we introduce the basic algorithm implemented in DART-RAY which is based on a pre-calculation of a lower limit for the RFED distribution. This pre-calculation allows us to estimate the extent of regions around the radiation sources within which these sources contribute signiﬁcantly to the RFED. In this way, ray-tracing calculations can be restricted to take place only within these regions, thus substantially reducing the computational time compared to a complete ray-tracing RT calculation. Anisotropic scattering is included in the code and handled in a similar fashion. Furthermore, the code utilizes a Cartesian adaptive spatial grid and an iterative method has been implemented to optimize the angular densities of the rays originated from each emitting cell. In order to verify the accuracy of the RT calculations performed by DART-RAY, we present results of comparisons with solutions obtained using the DUSTY 1D RT code for a dust shell illuminated by a central point source and existing 2D RT calculations of disc galaxies with diffusely distributed stellar emission and dust opacity. Finally, we show the application of the code on a spiral galaxy model with logarithmic spiral arms in order to measure the effect of the spiral pattern on the attenuation and RFED.",

Unambiguous constraints on the fraction of massive stars affected by binary interaction were lacking. We simultaneously measured all relevant binary characteristics in a sample of Galactic massive O stars and quantified the frequency and nature of binary interactions. More than 70% of all massive stars will exchange mass with a companion, leading to a binary merger in one-third of the cases. These numbers greatly exceed previous estimates and imply that binary interaction dominates the evolution of massive stars, with implications for populations of massive stars and their supernovae.\nAnalysis of a sample of massive stars in our Galaxy implies that most will interact with a nearby companion.\nAnalysis of a sample of massive stars in our Galaxy implies that most will interact with a nearby companion.",

The molecules, which are mainly organic in nature and comprise both normal and abnormal species, are located between stars, in regions known as interstellar clouds, which contain both gaseous material and material in the form of dust particles. The gas is well characterized by high-resolution spetroscopy, whereas the dust is less well characterized by low-resolution infrared spectroscopy and the scattering of visible radiation. The gaseous molecules are synthesized in situ from precursor atomic material, which derives from the mass loss of previous generations of stars. The chemical reactions involved in this synthesis are discussed in some detail as are the models that seek to reproduce the observed abundances of molecules.",

Using a significantly revised code, we have modelled these variations assuming the emission originates from the undisturbed WR star wind and a colliding wind shock region that partially wraps around the O star. Changes to the modelling code are chiefly in the form of additional parameters, intended to refine the modelling and facilitate comparison with recent predictions arising from theoretical and hydrodynamical work. This modelling provides measurements of crucial parameters such as the orbital inclination (63.5° ± 2.5°) and thus, together with the RV orbits, the stellar masses (11.7 ± 0.9 M<SUB>☉</SUB> for the WR star and 33.3 ± 2.0 M<SUB>☉</SUB> for the O star). We find good agreement with expectations based on theoretical studies and hydrodynamical modelling of colliding wind systems. Moreover, it raises the exciting prospect of providing a reliable method to learn more about WR stellar masses and winds, and for studying the physics of colliding winds in massive stars.",

However, only very few WN stars have been re-analyzed by means of line-blanketed models yet.<i>Aims.<i/>The quantitative spectral analysis of a large sample of Galactic WN stars with the most advanced generation of model atmospheres should provide an empirical basis for various studies about the origin, evolution, and physics of the Wolf-Rayet stars and their powerful winds.<i>Methods.<i/>We analyze a large sample of Galactic WN stars by means of the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmospheres, which account for iron line blanketing and clumping. The results are compared with a synthetic population, generated from the Geneva tracks for massive star evolution.<i>Results.<i/>We obtain a homogeneous set of stellar and atmospheric parameters for the Galactic WN stars, partly revising earlier results.<i>Conclusions.<i/>Comparing the results of our spectral analyses of the Galactic WN stars with the predictions of the Geneva evolutionary calculations, we conclude that there is rough qualitative agreement.

Large dust shells containing (amorphous carbon) grains are observed in persistent dust makers, such as the pinwheel system WR104 (WC9+OB) and periodic/episodic dust makers, such asWR140 (WC7+O) close to periastron. Problems with the nucleation and growth of dust in such harsh environments are discussed. It is probable that mixing of carbon-rich material from the WC star plus hydrogen from an OB companion, together with efficient shielding via the shocked region of their colliding winds, provides the necessary ingredients. Many problems with the nucleation and growth remain to be addressed.",

The X-ray luminosity and spectra of the\nshock-heated region, acounting for wind attenuation and the influence of different abundances on the resultant level and spectra of X-ray emission are calculated. A variety of dynamical instabilities that are found to dominate the intershock region is examined. These instabilities are found to be particularly important when postshock material is able to cool. These instabilities disrupt the postshock flow and add a time variability of order 10 percent to the X-ray luminosity. The X-ray spectrum of these systems is found to vary with the nuclear abundances of winds. These theoretical models are used to study several massive binary systems, in particular V444 Cyg and HD 193793.",

I discuss how massive-star formation can be understood as being due to competitive accretion in stellar clusters. Massive binary systems are then formed due to accretion onto wider low-mass systems. The combination of accretion and dynamical interactions with other stars in the cluster then result in producing a close binary system. Tidal and 3-body captures in dense stellar cores can also play a role in forming massive binary systems while stellar mergers of such close binary systems due to interactions may play an important role in overcoming the radiation pressure.",

It provides a comprehensive description of this important area of science, stressing in particular the methods that have been developed for specific purposes.

		"abstract": "I review driving mechanisms for stellar winds, using ﬁrst the example of the coronal, pressure-driven solar wind, but then focussing mainly on radiation-pressure driven winds from hot, luminous stars. For the latter, I review the central role of line-opacity as a coupling between matter and radiation, emphasizing how the Doppler shift of an accelerating wind outﬂow exposes the strong line opacity to a substantial continuum ﬂux, and thus allows the line force to sustain the outward acceleration against gravity. Through the CAK formalism that assumes a power-law distribution of line-opacity, I derive the mass loss rate and wind velocity law, and discuss how these are altered by various reﬁnements like a ﬁnite-disk correction, ionization variations in opacity, and a non-zero sound speed. I also discuss how multiline scattering in Wolf-Rayet (WR) winds can allow them to exceed the single scattering limit, for which the wind and radiative momenta are equal. Through a time-dependent perturbation analysis, I show how the line-driving leads to a fast, inward “Abbott-wave” mode for long wavelength perturbations, and a strong Line-Deshadowing-Instability at short wavelengths, summarizing also 1D and 2D numerical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of this instability. I next discuss how rapid stellar rotation alters the latitudinal variation of mass loss and ﬂow speed, and how this depends on treatment of gravity darkening, nonradial line forces, and “bi-stability” shifts in ionization. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of the large mass loss epochs of Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars, and how these might be modeled via superEddington, continuum driving moderated by the “porosity” associated with extensive spatial structure.",

The last six chapters illustrate applications of this material to linearised sound and water waves, to high speed flow of air, to non-linear water waves on channels, and to aerofoil theory. Over 350 diagrams have been used to illustrate key points. Exercises are included to help develop and reinforce the reader's understanding of the material presented. References at the ends of each chapter serve not only to guide readers to more detailed texts, but also list where alternative descriptions of the salient points in the chapter may be found.

In this spirit, this book may be said to treat fluid dynamies as a branch of physics, rather than as a branch of applied mathematics or of engineering. I have often heard expressions of the need for such a book, and certainly I have feIt it in my own teaching. I have written it primariIy for students of physics and of physics-based applied science, aIthough I hope others may find it useful. The book differs from existing 'fundamental' books in placing much greater emphasis on what we know through laboratory experiments and their physical interpretation and less on the mathe matieal formalism. It differs from existing 'applied' books in that the choice of topics has been made for the insight they give into the behaviour of fluids in motion rather than for their practical importance. There are differences also from many existing books on fluid dynamics in the branches treated, reflecting to some extent shifts of interest in reeent years. In particular, geophysical and astrophysical applications have prompted important fundamental developments in topics such as conveetion, stratified flow, and the dynamics of rotating fluids. These developments have hitherto been reflected in the contents of textbooks only to a limited extent.",

		"abstract": "Computational Fluid Dynamics: An Introduction grew out of a von Karman Institute (VKI) Lecture Series by the same title ?rst presented in 1985 and repeated with modi?cations every year since that time. The objective, then and now, was to present the subject of computational ?uid dynamics (CFD) to an audience unfamiliar with all but the most basic numerical techniques and to do so in such a way that the practical application of CFD would become clear to everyone. A second edition appeared in 1995 with updates to all the chapters and when that printing came to an end, the publisher requested that the editor and authors consider the preparation of a third edition. Happily, the authors received the request with enthusiasm. The third edition has the goal of presenting additional updates and clari?cations while preserving the introductory nature of the material. The book is divided into three parts. John Anderson lays out the subject in Part I by ?rst describing the governing equations of ?uid dynamics, concentrating on their mathematical properties which contain the keys to the choice of the numerical approach. Methods of discretizing the equations are discussed and transformation techniques and grids are presented. Two examples of numerical methods close out this part of the book: source and vortex panel methods and the explicit method. Part II is devoted to four self-contained chapters on more advanced material. Roger Grundmann treats the boundary layer equations and methods of solution.",

In particular, the response of the model to periodic driving at its inner boundary was examined for a considerable range of stellar parameters for both fundamental and overtone modes, various driving amplitudes, and various assumptions about the physical processes involved; radiation pressure on dust and time-dependent temperature relaxation were included. Stable steady state models with periodic shocks were obtained in all cases. Both shocks and dust were found to be essential for rapid mass loss. The shocks increase the density and thus greatly increase the amount of dust formed in the cool outer atmosphere. Radiation pressure accelerates the grains, which drive a slow cool wind. Calculated mass-loss rates appear to be of the right order of magnitude to agree with observations and show how mass loss can be expected to depend on the stellar parameters.",

Chemical concentration profiles are calculated for several envelope models by integrating the coupled continuity equations that include spherically expanding flows from an inner boundary at the shock formation radius. The influence of the 'inverse greenhouse' effect experienced by small PAHs is investigated and shown to increase the PAH yield by many orders of magnitude. It is shown that the route through propargyl radicals could be an important channel to produce benzene. PAH formation yields are found to be extremely sensitive to gas density and temperature and are much smaller than values inferred from the observed dust content of late-type carbon-rich stellar envelopes. It is therefore unlikely that aromatic molecules are generated in the stellar outflow itself.",

		"abstract": "The winds of cool luminous AGB stars are commonly assumed to be driven by radiative acceleration of dust grains which form in the extended atmospheres produced by pulsation-induced shock waves. The dust particles gain momentum by absorption or scattering of stellar photons, and they drag along the surrounding gas particles through collisions, triggering an outflow. This scenario, here referred to as Pulsation-Enhanced Dust-DRiven Outflow (PEDDRO), has passed a range of critical observational tests as models have developed from empirical and qualitative to increasingly self-consistent and quantitative. A reliable theory of mass loss is an essential piece in the bigger picture of stellar and galactic chemical evolution, and central for determining the contribution of AGB stars to the dust budget of galaxies. In this review, I discuss the current understanding of wind acceleration and indicate areas where further efforts by theorists and observers are needed.",

		"abstract": "<BR /> Aims: We model the synthesis of molecules and dust in the inner wind of the oxygen-rich Mira-type star IK Tau by considering the effects of periodic shocks induced by the stellar pulsation on the gas and by following the non-equilibrium chemistry in the shocked gas layers between 1 R<SUB>⋆</SUB> and 10 R<SUB>⋆</SUB>. We consider a very complete set of molecules and dust clusters, and combine the nucleation phase of dust formation with the condensation of these clusters into dust grains. We also test the impact of increasing the local gas density. Our derived molecular abundances and dust properties are compared to the most recent observational data. <BR /> Methods: A semi-analytical formalism based on parameterised fluid equations is used to describe the gas density, velocity, and temperature in the inner wind. The chemistry is described by using a chemical kinetic network of reactions and the condensation mechanism is described by a Brownian formalism. A set of stiff, ordinary, coupled differential equations is solved, and molecular abundances, dust cluster abundances, grain size distributions and dust masses are derived. <BR /> Results: The shocks drive an active non-equilibrium chemistry in the dust formation zone of IK Tau where the collision destruction of CO in the post-shock gas triggers the formation of C-bearing species such as HCN and CS. Most of the modelled molecular abundances agree well with the latest values derived from Herschel data, except for SO<SUB>2</SUB> and NH<SUB>3</SUB>, whose formation may not occur in the inner wind. Clusters of alumina, Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>, are produced within 2 R<SUB>⋆</SUB> and lead to a population of alumina grains close to the stellar surface. Clusters of silicates (Mg<SUB>2</SUB>SiO<SUB>4</SUB>) form at larger radii (r&gt; 3R<SUB>⋆</SUB>), where their nucleation is triggered by the formation of HSiO and H<SUB>2</SUB>SiO. They efficiently condense and reach their final grain size distribution between ~6 R<SUB>⋆</SUB> and 8 R<SUB>⋆</SUB> with a major population of medium size grains peaking at ~200 Å. This two dust-shell configuration agrees with recent interferometric observations. The derived dust-to-gas mass ratio for IK Tau is in the range 1-6 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> and agrees with values derived from observations of O-rich Mira-type stars. <BR /> Conclusions: Our results confirm the importance of periodic shocks in chemically shaping the inner wind of AGB stars and providing gas conditions conducive to the efficient synthesis of molecules and dust by non-equilibrium processes. They indicate that the wind acceleration will possibly develop in the radius range 4-8 R<SUB>⋆</SUB> in IK Tau.",

Previous aperture masking observations showed that WR104 is likely an interacting binary star at the end of its life. However, several aspects of the system are still unknown. This includes the opening angle of the spiral, the dust formation locus, and the link between the central binary star and a candidate companion star detected with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at 1\". Aims. Our aim was to directly image the dusty spiral or \"pinwheel\" structure around WR104 for the first time and determine its physical properties at large spatial scales. We also wanted to address the characteristics of the candidate companion detected by the HST. Methods. For this purpose, we used SPHERE and VISIR at the Very Large Telescope to respectively image the system in the near-and mid-infrared. Both instruments furnished an excellent view of the system at the highest angular resolution a single, ground-based telescope can provide. Based on these direct images, we then used analytical and radiative transfer models to determine several physical properties of the system. Results. Employing a different technique than previously used, our new images have allowed us to confirm the presence of the dust pinwheel around the central star. We have also detected up to 5 revolutions of the spiral pattern of WR104 in the K-band for the first time. The circumstellar dust extends up to 2 arcsec from the central binary star in the N-band, corresponding to the past 20 years of mass loss. Moreover, we found no clear evidence of a shadow of the first spiral coil onto the subsequent ones, which likely points to a dusty environment less massive than inferred in previous studies. We have also confirmed that the stellar candidate companion previously detected by the HST is gravitationally bound to WR104 and herein provide information about its nature and orbital elements.",

		"abstract": "Context. The collision of winds from massive stars in binaries results \nin the formation of a double-shock structure with observed signatures\nfrom radio to X-rays. Aims: We study the structure and stability\nof the colliding wind region as it turns into a spiral owing to the\norbital motion. We focus on adiabatic winds, where mixing between the\ntwo winds is expected to be restricted to the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability. Mixing of the Wolf-Rayet wind with hydrogen-rich material\nis important for dust formation in pinwheel nebulae such as WR 104,\nwhere the spiral structure has been resolved in infrared. \nMethods: We use the hydrodynamical code RAMSES to solve the equations of\nhydrodynamics on an adaptive grid. A wide range of binary systems with\ndifferent wind velocities and mass-loss rates are studied with\ntwo-dimensional simulations. A specific three-dimensional simulation is\nperformed to model WR 104. Results: Orbital\nmotion leads to the formation of two distinct spiral arms where the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability develops differently. We find that the\nspiral structure is destroyed when there is a large velocity gradient\nbetween the winds, unless the collimated wind is much faster. We argue\nthat the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability plays a major role in determining\nwhether the structure is maintained. We discuss the consequences for\nvarious colliding-wind binaries. When their spiral structure is stable,\nthere is no straightforward relationship between the spatial step of the\nspiral, the wind velocities, and the orbital period. Our 3D simulation\nof WR 104 indicates that the colder, well-mixed trailing arm has more\nfavourable conditions for dust formation than the leading arm. The\nsingle-arm infrared spiral follows more closely the mixing map than the\ndensity map, suggesting that the dust-to-gas ratio may vary between the\nleading and trailing density spirals. However, the density is much lower\nthan what dust formation models require. Including radiative cooling\nwould lead to higher densities, and also to thin shell instabilities\nwhose impact on the large-scale structure remains unknown.\n\nAppendices are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org",

		"abstract": "Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars represent one of the final stages of massive stellar evolution. Relatively little is known about this short-lived phase and we currently lack reliable mass, distance, and binarity determinations for a representative sample. Here we report the first visual orbit for WR 140 (= HD193793), a WC7+O5 binary system known for its periodic dust production episodes triggered by intense colliding winds near periastron passage. The Infrared-Optical Telescope Array and Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy interferometers resolved the pair of stars in each year from 2003 to 2009, covering most of the highly eccentric, 7.9 year orbit. Combining our results with the recently improved double-line spectroscopic orbit of Fahed et al., we find the WR 140 system is located at a distance of 1.67 ± 0.03\nkpc, composed of a WR star with M WR = 14.9 ± 0.5 M\n⊙ and an O star with M O = 35.9 ± 1.3 M\n⊙. Our precision orbit yields key parameters with\nuncertainties ~6× smaller than previous work and paves the way for detailed modeling of the system. Our newly measured flux ratios at the near-infrared H and Ks bands allow a spectral energy distribution decomposition and analysis of the component evolutionary states.",

Momentum balance equations are used to determine the position and shape of the contact discontinuity between the stars, while further downstream the gas is assumed to behave ballistically. An Archimedean spiral structure is formed by the motion of the stars, with clear resemblance to high-resolution images of the so-called ‘pinwheel nebulae’. A key advantage of this approach over grid or smoothed particle hydrodynamic models is its signiﬁcantly reduced computational cost, while it also allows the study of the structure obtained in an eccentric orbit. The model is relevant to symbiotic systems and γ -ray binaries, as well as systems with O-type and Wolf–Rayet stars.",

The dynamical effects of the winds are very modest. However, in the lower mass clouds, they inﬂuence the morphologies of the H II regions by creating 10-pc-scale central cavities. The inhomogeneous structures of the model giant molecular clouds (GMCs) make them highly permeable to photons, ionized gas and supernova ejecta, and the leaking of ionized gas in particular strongly affects their evolution, reducing the effectiveness of feedback. Nevertheless, feedback is able to expel large fractions of the mass of the lower escape velocity clouds. Its impact on star formation is more modest, decreasing ﬁnal star formation efﬁciencies by 10–20 per cent, and the rate of change of the star formation efﬁciency per freefall time by about one third. However, the clouds still form stars substantially faster than observed GMCs.",

Our analysis reveals phase-locked variations repeating consistently over many consecutive orbits, in agreement with an X-ray emission fully explained by thermal emission from the colliding winds in the 208-d orbit. We report on a signiﬁcant deviation of the X-ray ﬂux with respect to the 1/D trend (expected for adiabatic shocked winds) close to periastron passage. The absence of a drop in post-shock plasma temperature close to periastron suggests this break in trend cannot be explained in terms of reduced pre-shock velocities in this part of the orbit. Finally, NuSTAR data reveal a lack of hard X-ray emission (above 10.0 keV) above the background level. Upper limits on a putative non-thermal emission strongly suggest that the sensitivity of present hard X-ray observatories is not sufﬁcient to detect non-thermal emission from massive binaries above 10 keV, unless the wind kinetic power is large enough to signiﬁcantly feed particle acceleration in the wind-wind interaction.",

It has been shown that the models composed of the bare graphite and silicate grains together with the multilayer grains containing silicates, organic refractory and water ice, are more useful in explaining extinction under the reduced cosmic abundances. The models based on Mathis’ composite grains or on Greenberg & Li’s core-mantle grains can also provide quite good ﬁts of the extinction and the measured scattering parameters, but still require an excessive amount of carbon which results in too large a C/O ratio. The inhomogeneous grains essentially contribute to the extinction in practically the whole wavelength range of our extinction curves. As a rule, such grains have quite wide size distributions, centred at around 100 nm, although graphite grains are mainly of small sizes.",

The durations of the different evolutionary stages of massive core helium burning stars, which may be defined in terms of their surface chemical composition, have been estimated. This could be done by relating the time evolution of the surface hydrogen mass fraction to the interior hydrogen profile of stars at He-ignition via their average rates of mass loss due to stellar wind. Several observational details can be explained in this way, especially the high mean mass of WNL stars and the low mean mass of WNE stars. Further it is suggested that very massive stars explode as WNL stars.",

This census of galactic WR stars reaches 227 stars, comprising 127 WN stars, 87 WC stars, 10 WN/WC stars and 3 WO stars. This includes 15 WNL and 11 WCL stars within 30 pc of the Galactic Center. We compile and discuss WR spectral classification, variability, periodicity, binarity, terminal wind velocities, correlation with open clusters and OB associations, and correlation with Hi bubbles, Hii regions and ring nebulae. Intrinsic colours and absolute visual magnitudes per subtype are re-assessed for a re-determination of optical photometric distances and galactic distribution of WR stars. In the solar neighbourhood we find projected on the galactic plane a surface density of 3.3 WR stars per kpc2, with a WC/WN number ratio of 1.5, and a WR binary frequency (including probable binaries) of 39%. The galactocentric distance (RWR) distribution per subtype shows RWR increasing with decreasing WR subtype, both for the WN and WC subtypes. This RWR distribution allows for the possibility of WNE→WCE and WNL→WCL subtype evolution.",

Relativistic protons and electrons are assumed to be accelerated through diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) at the global shocks bounding the wind-wind collision region. The non-linear effects of the back-reaction due to the cosmic ray pressure on the particle acceleration process and the cooling of the non-thermal particles as they flow downstream from the shocks are included. We explore how the non-thermal particle distribution and the keV-GeV emission changes with the stellar separation and the viewing angle of the system, and with the momentum ratio of the winds. We confirm earlier findings that DSA is very efficient when magnetic field amplification is not included, leading to significantly modified shocks. We also find that the non-thermal flux scales with the binary separation in a complicated way and that the anisotropic inverse Compton emission shows only a moderate variation with viewing angle due to the spatial extent of the wind-wind collision.",

Different novel manycore architectures have emerged in recent years on the way towards the exascale era. Performance portability is required to prevent repeated non-trivial refactoring of a code for different architectures. We combine Athena++, an existing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) CPU code, with Kokkos, a performance portable on-node parallel programming paradigm, into K-Athena to allow efficient simulations on multiple architectures using a single codebase. We present profiling and scaling results for different platforms including Intel Skylake CPUs, Intel Xeon Phis, and NVIDIA GPUs. K-Athena achieves $>10^8$ cell-updates/s on a single V100 GPU for second-order double precision MHD calculations, and a speedup of 30 on up to 24,576 GPUs on Summit (compared to 172,032 CPU cores), reaching $1.94\\times10^{12}$ total cell-updates/s at 76% parallel efficiency. Using a roofline analysis we demonstrate that the overall performance is currently limited by DRAM bandwidth and calculate a performance portability metric of 62.8%. Finally, we present the implementation strategies used and the challenges encountered in maximizing performance. This will provide other research groups with a straightforward approach to prepare their own codes for the exascale era. K-Athena is available at https://gitlab.com/pgrete/kathena .",

		"abstract": "The design and implementation of a new framework for adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) calculations is described. It is intended primarily for applications in astrophysical fluid dynamics, but its flexible and modular design enables its use for a wide variety of physics. The framework works with both uniform and nonuniform grids in Cartesian and curvilinear coordinate systems. It adopts a dynamic execution model based on a simple design called a \"task list\" that improves parallel performance by overlapping communication and computation, simplifies the inclusion of a diverse range of physics, and even enables multiphysics models involving different physics in different regions of the calculation. We describe physics modules implemented in this framework for both non-relativistic and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). These modules adopt mature and robust algorithms originally developed for the Athena MHD code and incorporate new extensions: support for curvilinear coordinates, higher-order time integrators, more realistic physics such as a general equation of state, and diffusion terms that can be integrated with super-time-stepping algorithms. The modules show excellent performance and scaling, with well over 80% parallel efficiency on over half a million threads. The source code has been made publicly available.",

Hyperion is parallelized, and is shown to scale well to thousands of processes. Two common benchmark models for protoplanetary disks were computed, and the results are found to be in excellent agreement with those from other codes. Finally, to demonstrate the capabilities of the code, dust temperatures, SEDs, and synthetic multi-wavelength images were computed for a dynamical simulation of a low-mass star formation region.

Destruction rates for grains are estimated as a function of size, composition, and type of region in which the grains are located, and the relative importance of the different mechanisms is evaluated. Grain destruction behind steady-state shock waves is examined, grain motion and sputtering in the cooling postshock gas is analyzed, and numerical results for the fractional grain mass sputtered are given for various preshock conditions, grain types and sizes, and shock speeds of 10 to 350 km/s. Grain sputtering in spherically symmetric supernova remnants is investigated as a function of supernova energy and ambient density. The results are applied to consider the destruction of grains (1) in collisions between randomly moving interstellar clouds; (2) in\nsupernovae in a 'one-phase', a 'two-phase', and a 'three-phase' ISM; (3) by sputtering in H II regions; (4) by cosmic-ray sputtering; (5) by UV photodesorption; and (6) by sublimation of volatile mantles from grains heated in H II regions or by supernova radiation.",

The resulting grain potentials are (for temperatures of at least about 100,000 K) considerably smaller in magnitude than found by Burke and Silk (1974). Even so, large electrostatic stresses can cause ion field emission and rapid destruction of small grains in very hot gas. Rapid rotation can also disrupt small grains, but damping (by microwave emission) usually limits the centrifugal stress to acceptable values for plasma densities of no more than about 1 per cu cm. Sputtering rates are estimated for grains in hot gas, based upon a semiempirical fit to experimental data. Predicted sputtering rates for possible grain constituents are similar to estimates by Barlow (1978), but in some cases differ significantly. Useful approximation formulas are given for the drag forces acting on a grain with arbitrary Mach number.",

The program calculates the intensity emerging from these complicated structures using a combination of step-size controlled ray-tracing and adaptive multi-wavelength photon transport grids. Along with a 2nd order finite differencing approach, the grids are optimized to reduce the discretization error and provide global error control. The full wavelength-dependent problem is solved without any flux approximation, and for arbitrary scattering properties of the dust. The program is designed to provide spatially resolved images, visibilities, and spectra of complex dust distributions even without any symmetry for wavelengths ranging from the UV to FIR and allows for multiple internal and external sources. In this paper, the algorithm is described and the capabilities of the code are illustrated by the treatment of 1D and 3D test cases. Analyzing the properties of typical cosmic dust, we discuss the wavelength range for which the time-consuming solution on adaptive grids can be omitted. The temperature is calculated self-consistently using standard accelerated <i>Λ<i/>-iteration.",

A simple conservative high-order ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme that works in combination with all available physics modules is introduced and demonstrated at the example of monotonicity preserving ﬁfth order reconstruction. Strong stability preserving high order Runge-Kutta time steppers are used to obtain stable evolutions in multi-dimensional applications realizing up to fourth order accuracy in space and time. With the new distinction between active and passive grid cells, MPI-AMRVAC is ideally suited to simulate evolutions where parts of the solution are controlled analytically, or have a tendency to progress into or out of a stationary state. Typical test problems and representative applications are discussed, with an outlook to follow-up research. Finally, we discuss the parallel scaling of the code and demonstrate excellent weak scaling up to 30 000 processors allowing to exploit modern peta-scale infrastructure.",

In this talk, I will discuss our analysis revisiting the impact of dust formation in the colliding winds of carbon-rich\nWolf-Rayet (WC) binaries. By conducting a dust SED analysis of 19 Galactic WC dust-producers, we find that these sources exhibit a wide range of dust production rates (DPR) from ~10-10 -\n~10-5 MSun yr-1. For WC systems with a known orbital period we find a decreasing DPR with increasing orbital period, which highlights the impact on the binary orbital parameters on their dust formation. We incorporate dust production into the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) models at a range of\nmetallicities to study the relative dust contribution from WC binaries amongst other leading dust input sources such as AGB and RSG stars and supernova ejecta. For a constant star formation history, our results suggest that WC binaries dominate the dust production over AGBs and RSGs. WC binaries notably present an important dust source if supernovae are net destroyers of dust. Lastly, I will discuss our planned JWST DD-ERS program to investigate the formation and chemical composition of dust formed in the archetypal periodic WC binary system WR140.",

Results\nfrom these models provide inputs for exospheric models. The most common\nsputter models use the binary collision approximation (BCA), such as\nSDTrim.SP. While these models are typically accurate for high impact\nenergies, the approximations can potentially introduce error for low\nenergy impacts or crystalline targets. In contrast, Molecular Dynamics\n(MD) simulations remove the BCA approximation and are able to simulate\nthe entire collision cascade, albeit at a high computational cost. MD\nsimulations also allow one to control the properties of the initial\nsubstrate, including crystalline structure, temperature, crystal damage,\nand roughness. However, MD simulations can require several user specific\nchoices, such as interatomic potential, that can affect accuracy. Before\neither BCA or MD models can be confidently used to simulate planetary\nsurface ion impacts, it is important to verify their ranges of\napplicability and limitations by comparison to pre-existing experimental\nvalues. Specifically, we consider a copper substrate impacted by argon\nions with kinetic energies between 200-1000 eV and compare the SDTrim.SP\nand MD results to the experimental values for the resulting sputtering\nyield and energy distributions. In addition, we compare results with the\ncommonly used Thompson model for the energy distributions. Overall, our\nfindings highlight the potential advantages for MD simulations when\nspecific substrate and simulation parameters are desired.",

		"abstract": "The recent discovery of a spectacular dust plume in the system 2XMM J160050.7–514245 (referred to as ‘Apep’) suggested a physical origin in a colliding-wind binary by way of the ‘Pinwheel’ mechanism. Observational data pointed to a hierarchical triple-star system, however, several extreme and unexpected physical properties seem to defy the established physics of such objects. Most notably, a stark discrepancy was found in the observed outﬂow speed of the gas as measured spectroscopically in the line-of-sight direction compared to the proper motion expansion of the dust in the sky plane. This enigmatic behaviour arises at the wind base within the central Wolf–Rayet binary: a system that has so far remained spatially unresolved. Here, we present an updated proper motion study deriving the expansion speed of Apep’s dust plume over a 2-year baseline that is four times slower than the spectroscopic wind speed, conﬁrming and strengthening the previous ﬁnding. We also present the results from high angular resolution near-infrared imaging studies of the heart of the system, revealing a close binary with properties matching a Wolf–Rayet colliding-wind system. Based on these new observational constraints, an improved geometric model is presented yielding a close match to the data, constraining the orbital parameters of the Wolf–Rayet binary and lending further support to the anisotropic wind model.",

		"abstract": "Wolf–Rayet (WR) stars are evolved massive stars, presumably on their way to becoming supernovae. They are characterized by high luminosities and fast and dense stellar winds. We have detected signs of a radio continuum pinwheel associated with WR 147, a nitrogen-rich WR star with spectral subtype WN8. These structures are known to exist around a handful of late-type carbon-rich WR stars with massive companions where dust has formed in the zone where the two winds collide and produced a plume of dense gas and dust that is carried out with the WR wind. As the binary system rotates, an Archimedean spiral detectable in the infrared is formed. The resulting pinwheel contains information on wind speeds, wind-momentum ratio, and orbital parameters. However, WR 147 is a WN star and the formation of dust is unlikely, so a different emission mechanism must be at work. Our analysis of the data suggests that in this case the emission is dominantly of a nonthermal nature (synchrotron), although we cannot exclude the possibility that some clumps could be brighter in free–free emission. It is possible that the pinwheels associated with WN stars will be detectable only as nonthermal emitters at radio wavelengths. From the characteristics of the pinwheel we estimate a period of 1.7 yr for the binary system (the WN8 star and a companion yet undetected directly) that is responsible for the pinwheel.",

These structures are known to encode the parameters of the binary orbit and winds2–4. Here we report observations of a previously undiscovered Wolf–Rayet system, 2XMM J160050.7–514245, with a spectroscopically determined wind speed of ~3,400 km s−1. In the thermal infrared, the system is adorned with a prominent ~12″ spiral dust plume, revealed by proper motion studies to be expanding at only ~570 km s−1. As the dust and gas appear to be coeval, these observations are inconsistent with existing models of the dynamics of such colliding-wind systems5–7. We propose that this contradiction can be resolved if the system is capable of launching extremely anisotropic winds. Near-critical stellar rotation is known to drive such winds8,9, suggesting that this Wolf–Rayet system may be a Galactic progenitor system for long-duration gamma-ray bursts.",

		"abstract": "WR 118 is a highly evolved Wolf-Rayet star of the WC10 subtype surrounded by a permanent dust shell absorbing and re-emitting in the infrared a considerable fraction of the stellar luminosity. We present the ﬁrst diﬀraction-limited 2.13 µm speckle interferometric observations of WR 118 with 73 mas resolution. The speckle interferograms were obtained with the 6 m telescope at the Special Astrophysical Observatory. The twodimensional visibility function of the object does not show any signiﬁcant deviation from circular symmetry. The visibility curve declines towards the diﬀraction cut-oﬀ frequency to ∼0.66 and can be approximated by a linear function. Radiative transfer calculations have been carried out to model the spectral energy distribution, given in the range of 0.5–25 µm, and our 2.13 µm visibility function, assuming spherical symmetry of the dust shell. Both can be ﬁtted with a model containing double-sized grains (“small” and “large”) with the radii of a = 0.05 µm and 0.38 µm, and a mass fraction of the large grains greater than 65%. Alternatively, a good match can be obtained with the grain size distribution function n(a) ∼ a−3, with a ranging between 0.005 µm and 0.6 µm. At the inner boundary of the modelled dust shell (angular diameter Θin = (17±1) mas), the temperature of the smallest grains and the dust shell density are 1750 K ± 100 K and (1 ± 0.2) × 10−19 g/cm3, respectively. The dust formation rate is found to be (1.3 ± 0.5) × 10−7 M /yr, assuming Vwind = 1200 km s−1.",

The three stars show a sequence of increasing O II and O III line strengths, conﬁrming and extending earlier studies.

The WC9 emission-line spectra are shown to be less uniform than previously thought, showing a significant range of O ii line strengths. The only two WC9 stars in the observed sample that do not make circumstellar dust, WR 81 (He3±1316) and WR 92 (HD 157451), are found to have anomalously weak O ii and strong He ii lines.

These data provide the empirical basis of studies of (i) the role of WC stars in the evolution of massive stars, (ii) the wind-driving mechanisms, and (iii) the feedback of WC stars as input to models of the chemical and dynamical evolution of galaxies. Methods: We analyze the nearly complete sample of un-obscured Galactic WC stars, using optical spectra as well as ultraviolet spectra when available. The observations are fitted with theoretical spectra, using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. A large grid of line-blanked models has been established for the range of WC subtypes WC4 - WC8, and smaller grids for the WC9 parameter domain. Both WO stars and WN/WC transit types are also analyzed using special models. Results: Stellar and atmospheric parameters are derived for more than 50 GalacticWC and two WO stars, covering almost the whole GalacticWC population as far as the stars are single, and un-obscured in the visual. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, theWC stars reside between the hydrogen and the helium zero-age main sequences, having luminosities L from 10^4.9 to 10^5.6 Lsun. The mass-loss rates scale very tightly with L^0.8. The two WO stars in our sample turn out to be outstandingly hot (\\approx200 kK) and do not fit into the WC scheme. Conclusions: By comparing the empirical WC positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with evolutionary models, and from recent supernova statistics, we conclude that WC stars have evolved from initial masses between 20 solar masses and 45 Msun. In contrast to previous assumptions, it seems that WC stars in general do not descend from the most massive stars. Only the WO stars might stem from progenitors that have been initially more massive than 45 Msun.",

With these measurements, we derive stellar masses of $M_{\\rm WR} = 10.31\\pm 0.45 \\, \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and $M_{\\rm O} = 29.27\\pm 1.14 \\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot }$. We also include a discussion of the evolutionary history of this system from the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis model grid to show that this WR star likely formed primarily through mass-loss in the stellar winds, with only a moderate amount of mass lost or transferred through binary interactions.",

Both absorption and emission components showed strong variations. The variation of the absorption component as the O5 star was occulted by the wind-collision region (WCR) sets a tight constraint on its geometry. While the sightline to the O5 star traversed the WCR, the strength and breadth of the absorption component varied significantly on time-scales of days. An emission subpeak was observed on all our profiles. The variation of its radial velocity with orbital phase was shown to be consistent with formation in the WCR as it swung round the stars in their orbit. Modelling the profile gives a measure of the extent of the subpeak-forming region. In the phase range 0.93–0.99, the flux in the subpeak increased steadily, approximately inversely proportionally to the stellar separation, indicating that the shocked gas in the WCR where the line was formed was adiabatic. After periastron, the subpeak flux was anomalously strong and varied rapidly, suggesting formation in clumps downstream in the WCR. For most of the time, its flux exceeded the 2–10-keV X-ray emission, showing it to be a significant coolant of the shocked wind.",

		"abstract": "We present Spitzer/InfraRed Array Camera observations of dust formation from six extragalactic carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WC) binary candidates in low-metallicity (Z ≲ 0.65 Z ⊙) environments using multiepoch mid-infrared (IR) imaging data from the SPitzer InfraRed Intensive Transients Survey (SPIRITS). Optical follow-up spectroscopy of SPIRITS 16ln, 19q, 16df, 18hb, and 14apu reveals emission features from C iv λ5801−12 and/or the C iii–iv λ4650/He ii λ4686 blend that are consistent with early-type WC stars. We identify SPIRITS 16ln as the variable mid-IR counterpart of the recently discovered colliding-wind WC4 + O binary candidate, N604-WRXc, located in the subsolar metallicity NGC 604 H ii region in M33. We interpret the mid-IR variability from SPIRITS 16ln as a dust-formation episode in an eccentric colliding-wind WC binary. SPIRITS 19q, 16df, 14apu, and 18hb exhibit absolute [3.6] magnitudes exceeding that of one of the most IR-luminous dust-forming WC systems known, WR 104 (M [3.6] ≲ −12.3). An analysis of dust formation in the mid-IR outburst from SPIRITS 19q reveals a high dust production rate of M ⊙ yr−1, which may therefore exceed that of the most efficient dust-forming WC systems known. We demonstrate that efficient dust formation is feasible from early-type WC binaries in the theoretical framework of colliding-wind binary dust formation if the systems host an O-type companion with high mass-loss rates ( M ⊙ yr−1). This efficient dust formation from early-type WC binaries highlights their potential role as significant sources of dust in low-metallicity environments.",

Although these systems can produce copious amounts of dust, they have been commonly overlooked as significant sources of dust in the ISM of galaxies in the local and early Universe due to the persisting mysteries on their dust formation and the influence of binary companions. In this talk, I will discuss the results and plans from our research program that combines archival data thermal IR observations, new imaging and spectroscopic data from Subaru/COMICS, and approved Early Release Science observations with JWST in Cycle 1. I will highlight our major results that uniquely combine a comprehensive dust SED analysis of Galactic dust-forming WC stars with Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) models and show that WC binaries are early sources and significant sources of dust at LMC-like and solar metallicities in constant star-forming environments.",

		"abstract": "We construct revised near-infrared absolute magnitude calibrations for 126 Galactic Wolf–Rayet (WR) stars at known distances, based in part upon recent large-scale spectroscopic surveys. Application to 246 WR stars located in the field permits us to map their Galactic distribution. As anticipated, WR stars generally lie in the thin disc (∼40 pc half-width at half-maximum) between Galactocentric radii 3.5–10 kpc, in accordance with other star formation tracers. We highlight 12 WR stars located at vertical distances of ≥300 pc from the mid-plane. Analysis of the radial variation in WR subtypes exposes a ubiquitously higher NWC/NWN ratio than predicted by stellar evolutionary models accounting for stellar rotation. Models for non-rotating stars or accounting for close binary evolution are more consistent with observations. We consolidate information acquired about the known WR content of the Milky Way to build a simple model of the complete population. We derive observable quantities over a range of wavelengths, allowing us to estimate a total number of 1900  ±  250 Galactic WR stars, implying an average duration of ∼ 0.4 Myr for the WR phase at the current Milky Way star formation rate. Of relevance to future spectroscopic surveys, we use this model WR population to predict follow-up spectroscopy to KS  ≃  17.5 mag will be necessary to identify 95 per cent of Galactic WR stars. We anticipate that ESA's Gaia mission will make few additional WR star discoveries via low-resolution spectroscopy, though will significantly refine existing distance determinations. Appendix A provides a complete inventory of 322 Galactic WR stars discovered since the VIIth catalogue (313 including Annex), including a revised nomenclature scheme.",

		"abstract": "We present radiative-transfer modelling of the dusty spiral Pinwheel Nebula observed around the Wolf–Rayet/OB-star binary WR 104. The models are based on the three-dimensional radiative-transfer code torus, modified to include an adaptive mesh that allows us to adequately resolve both the inner spiral turns (subau scales) and the outer regions of the nebula (distances of 104 au from the central source). The spiral model provides a good fit to both the spectral energy distribution and Keck aperture masking interferometry, reproducing both the maximum entropy recovered images and the visibility curves. We deduce a dust creation rate of 8 ± 1 × 10−7 M⊙ yr−1, corresponding to approximately 2 per cent by mass of the carbon produced by the Wolf–Rayet star. Simultaneous modelling of the imaging and spectral data enables us to constrain both the opening angle of the wind–wind collision interface and the dust grain size. We conclude that the dust grains in the inner part of the Pinwheel Nebula are small (∼100 Å), in agreement with theoretical predictions, although we cannot rule out the presence of larger grains (∼1 μm) further from the central binary. The opening angle of the wind–wind collision interface appears to be about 40°, in broad agreement with the wind parameters estimated for the central binary. We discuss the success and deficiencies of the model, and the likely benefits of applying similar techniques to the more complex nebulae observed around other WR/O star binaries.",

The formation of dust is the least expected, and hardest to understand, process attributed to colliding stellar winds, and direct evidence of the connection is only now becoming available.

		"abstract": "We have undertaken a statistical study of the component mass ratios and the orbital eccentricities of WR + O close binary, detached main-sequence (DMS), contact early-type (CE), and semidetached (SD) systems. A comparison of the characteristics of WR + O systems and of DMS, CE, and SD systems has enabled us to draw certain conclusions about the evolutionary paths of WR + O binaries and to demonstrate that up to 90% of all known WR + O binaries formed as a result of mass transfer in massive close O + O binary systems. Since there is a clear correlation between the component masses in SD systems with subgiants, the absence of an anticorrelation between the masses of the WR stars and O stars in WR + O binaries cannot be considered evidence against the formation of WR + O binaries via mass transfer. The spectroscopic transitional orbital period Ptrspcorresponding to the transition from nearly circular orbits (esp<0.1) to elliptical orbits (esp≥0.1) is ∼14d for WR + O systems and ∼2d–3d for OB + OB systems. The period range in which all WR + O orbits are circular $$(1\\mathop d\\limits_. 6 \\leqslant P \\leqslant 14^d )$$is close to the range for SD systems with subgiants, $$0\\mathop d\\limits_. 7 \\leqslant P \\leqslant 15^d $$. The large difference between the Ptrspvalues for WR + O and OB + OB systems suggests that a mechanism of orbit circularization additional to that for OB + OB systems at the DMS stage (tidal dissipation of the orbital energy due to radiative damping of the dynamical tides) acts in WR + O binaries. It is natural to suggest mass transfer in the parent O + O binaries as this supplementary orbit-circularization mechanism. Since the transitional period between circular and elliptical orbits for close binaries with convective envelopes and ages of 5×109 years is $$P_{tr}  = 12\\mathop d\\limits_. 4$$, the orbits of most known SD systems with subgiants had enough time to circularize during the DMS stage, prior to the mass transfer. Thus, for most SD systems, mass transfer plays a secondary role in circularization of their orbits.",

Changes to the modelling code are chieﬂy in the form of additional parameters, intended to reﬁne the modelling and facilitate comparison with recent predictions arising from theoretical and hydrodynamical work. This modelling provides measurements of crucial parameters such as the orbital inclination (63.5◦ ± 2.5◦) and thus, together with the RV orbits, the stellar masses (11.7 ± 0.9 M for the WR star and 33.3 ± 2.0 M for the O star).

		"abstract": "Context. The life cycles of massive stars from the main sequence to their explosion as supernovae or gamma ray bursts are not yet fully clear, and the empirical results from spectral analyses are partly in conflict with current evolutionary models. The spectral analysis of Wolf-Rayet stars requires the detailed modeling of expanding stellar atmospheres in non-LTE. The Galactic WN stars have been comprehensively analyzed with such models of the latest stage of sophistication, while a similarly comprehensive study of the Galactic WC sample remains undone. <BR /> Aims: We aim to establish the stellar parameters and mass-loss rates of the Galactic WC stars. These data provide the empirical basis of studies of (i) the role of WC stars in the evolution of massive stars, (ii) the wind-driving mechanisms, and (iii) the feedback of WC stars as input to models of the chemical and dynamical evolution of galaxies. <BR /> Methods: We analyze the nearly complete sample of un-obscured Galactic WC stars, using optical spectra as well as ultraviolet spectra when available. The observations are fitted with theoretical spectra, using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. A large grid of line-blanked models has been established for the range of WC subtypes WC4 - WC8, and smaller grids for the WC9 parameter domain. Both WO stars and WN/WC transit types are also analyzed using special models. <BR /> Results: Stellar and atmospheric parameters are derived for more than 50 Galactic WC and two WO stars, covering almost the whole Galactic WC population as far as the stars are single, and un-obscured in the visual. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, the WC stars reside between the hydrogen and the helium zero-age main sequences, having luminosities L from 10<SUP>4.9</SUP> to 10<SUP>5.6</SUP> L<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The mass-loss rates scale very tightly with L<SUP>0.8</SUP>. The two WO stars in our sample turn out to be outstandingly hot (≈200 kK) and do not fit into the WC scheme. <BR /> Conclusions: By comparing the empirical WC positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with evolutionary models, and from recent supernova statistics, we conclude that WC stars have evolved from initial masses between 20 solar masses and 45 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. In contrast to previous assumptions, it seems that WC stars in general do not descend from the most massive stars. Only the WO stars might stem from progenitors that have been initially more massive than 45 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. <P />Appendices A and B are available in electronic form at <A href=\"http://www.aanda.org\">http://www.aanda.org</A>",

		"abstract": "Context. Mass loss from massive stars forms an important aspect of the evolution of massive stars, as well as for the enrichment of the surrounding interstellar medium. <BR /> Aims: Our goal is to predict accurate mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities. These quantities can be compared to empirical values, thereby testing radiation-driven wind models. One specific topical issue is that of the so-called \"weak-wind problem\", where empirically derived mass-loss rates and (modified) wind momenta fall orders of magnitude short of predicted values. <BR /> Methods: We employ an established Monte Carlo model and a recently suggested new line acceleration formalism to solve the wind dynamics more consistently. <BR /> Results: We provide a new grid of mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities of O-type stars, and compare the values to empirical results. Our models fail to provide mass-loss rates for main-sequence stars below a luminosity of log(L/L<SUB>☉</SUB>) = 5.2, where we appear to run into a fundamental limit. At luminosities below this critical value there is insufficient momentum transferred to the wind in the region below the sonic point in order to kick-start the acceleration of the flow. This problem occurs at almost the exact location of the onset of the weak-wind problem. For O dwarfs, the boundary between being able to start a wind, and failing to do so, is at spectral type O6/O6.5. The direct cause of this failure for O6.5 stars is a combination of the lower luminosity and a lack of Fe v lines at the base of the wind. This might indicate that - in addition to radiation pressure - another mechanism is required to provide the necessary driving to initiate the wind acceleration. <BR /> Conclusions: For stars more luminous than 10<SUP>5.2</SUP> L<SUB>☉</SUB>, our new mass-loss rates are in excellent agreement with the mass-loss prescription by Vink et al. (2000, A&amp;A, 362, 295) using our terminal wind velocities as input to this recipe. This implies that the main assumption entering the method of the Vink et al. prescriptions - i.e. that the momentum equation is not explicitly solved for - does not compromise the reliability of the Vink et al. results for this part of parameter space. Finally, our new models predict terminal velocities that are typically 35 and 45 percent larger than observed values. Such over-predictions are similar to those from (modified) CAK-theory.",

It examines the underlying physical processes that govern the evolution from a molecular cloud core to a main-sequence star, and focuses on the formation of solar-mass stars. Each chapter combines theory and observation, helping readers to connect with and understand the theory behind star formation. Beginning with an explanation of the interstellar medium and molecular clouds as sites of star formation, subsequent chapters address the building of typical stars and the formation of high-mass stars, concluding with a discussion of the by-products and consequences of star formation. This is a unique, self-contained text with sufficient background information for self-study, and is ideal for students and professional researchers alike.",

Obtaining complete samples of such stars across a large range of metallicities poses observational challenges, but presents us with an exacting way to test current stellar evolutionary theories. A technique we have developed and refined involves interference filter imaging combined with image subtraction and crowded-field photometry. This helps us address one of the most controversial topics in current massive star research: the relative importance of binarity in the evolution of massive stars and formation of WRs. Here, we discuss the current state of the field, including how the observed WR populations match with the predictions of both single and binary star evolutionary models. We end with what we believe are the most important next steps in WR research.",

		"abstract": "The progenitors of many Type II core-collapse supernovae (SNe) have now been identified directly on pre-discovery imaging. Here, we present an extensive search for the progenitors of Type Ibc SNe in all available pre-discovery imaging since 1998. There are 12 Type Ibc SNe with no detections of progenitors in either deep ground-based or Hubble Space Telescope archival imaging. The deepest absolute BVR magnitude limits are between −4 and − 5 mag. We compare these limits with the observed Wolf–Rayet population in the Large Magellanic Cloud and estimate a 16 per cent probability that we have failed to detect such a progenitor by chance. Alternatively, the progenitors evolve significantly before core-collapse or we have underestimated the extinction towards the progenitors. Reviewing the relative rates and ejecta mass estimates from light-curve modelling of Ibc SNe, we find both incompatible with Wolf–Rayet stars with initial masses &gt;25 M⊙ being the only progenitors. We present binary evolution models that fit these observational constraints. Stars in binaries with initial masses ≲ 20 M⊙ lose their hydrogen envelopes in binary interactions to become low-mass helium stars. They retain a low-mass hydrogen envelope until ≈104 yr before core-collapse; hence, it is not surprising that Galactic analogues have been difficult to identify.",

		"abstract": "The characteristics of many close, evolved binaries can be understood most easily if there exists some agency that can abstract angular momentum or mass, or both, from the precursor system. Close binaries may be defined as systems in which at least one of the components has filled or will fill its Roche lobe and attempt to transfer matter to its companion. If the timescale for mass transfer is considerablyy shorter than the timescale on which the accretor can adjust thermally to the proferred mass, the accreted layer will heat up, expand, and fill the Roche lobe of the accretor. The mass lost by the donor thereafter flows into a \"common envelope\" (CE) which encomapsses both stars. The frictional interaction between this common envelope and the stellar cores produces drag forces that cause the cores to spiral in toward one another; some of the orbital energy helps drive matter from the CE into interstellar space. Examples of the systems which are experiencing or have experienced this process include some planetary nebulae, cataclysmic variables, and close binary degenerate stars. Similar situations can arise if one of the components can support, of its own accord, a dense wind that flows out of the system; the drag luminosity produced by interaction between the companion and the wind may intensify the wind and contribute tot eh mass loss from the donor. Systems undergoing this \"wind-CE\" process include novae and close binaries containing a Wolf-Rayet star. Planetary nebulae with close binary central stars are actually ejected CEs, and precursors of many cataclysmic variables were once the central stars of planetary nebulae formed in a CE event. In this review, we (1) describe various initial configurations which will produce a CE, (2) discuss the physics of the CE event, (3) describe attempts to model the event quantiatively, and (4) apply what we have learned to describe, in several real situations, the tarnsformations wrought by evolution through a CE phase.

Here, Mario Vietri approaches the basics of high-energy astrophysics with an emphasis on underlying physical processes as opposed to a more mathematical approach. Alongside more traditional topics, Vietri presents new subjects increasingly considered crucial to understanding high-energy astrophysical sources, including the electrodynamics of cosmic sources, new developments in the theory of standard accretion disks, and the physics of coronae, thick disks, and accretion onto magnetized objects. The most thorough and engaging survey of high-energy astrophysics available today, Foundations of High-Energy Astrophysics introduces the main physical processes relevant to the field in a rigorous yet accessible way, while paying careful attention to observational issues. Vietri’s book will quickly become a classic text for students and active researchers in astronomy and astrophysics. Those in adjoining fields will also find it a valuable addition to their personal libraries.",

Recent observations have indicated that hydrogen-free WR stars have cooler temperatures than those predicted by current evolutionary models. To investigate how varying mass-loss rate affects WR evolution, we have created a grid of pure helium star models. We compare our results with Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud WR observations and show that the temperature ranges of observed WR stars can be reproduced by varying the mass-loss rate, which effectively determines the size of the helium envelope around the core. We also find that WN and WO stars arise from more massive stars, whereas WC stars come from lower masses. This contradicts the standard Conti scenario by which WN and WC stars evolve in an age sequence. We also predict the magnitudes of our models at core-collapse and compare with observations of nearby progenitors of Type Ib/c supernovae. We confirm the findings of previous studies that suggest WR stars are the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae; the progenitors would remain unobserved except in the cases where the progenitor is a low-mass helium giant, as is the case of iPTF13bvn.",

		"abstract": "Context. Massive stars play a vital role in the Universe, however, their evolution even on the main-sequence is not yet well understood. <BR /> Aims: Because of the steep mass-luminosity relation, massive main-sequence stars become extremely luminous. This brings their envelopes very close to the Eddington limit. We analyse stellar evolutionary models in which the Eddington limit is reached and exceeded, explore the rich diversity of physical phenomena that take place in their envelopes, and investigate their observational consequences. <BR /> Methods: We use published grids of detailed stellar models, computed with a state-of-the-art, one-dimensional hydrodynamic stellar evolution code using LMC composition, to investigate the envelope properties of core hydrogen burning massive stars. <BR /> Results: We find that the Eddington limit is almost never reached at the stellar surface, even for stars up to 500 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. When we define an appropriate Eddington limit locally in the stellar envelope, we can show that most stars more massive than ~40 M<SUB>☉</SUB> actually exceed this limit, in particular, in the partial ionisation zones of iron, helium, or hydrogen. While most models adjust their structure such that the local Eddington limit is exceeded at most by a few per cent, our most extreme models do so by a factor of more than seven. We find that the local violation of the Eddington limit has severe consequences for the envelope structure, as it leads to envelope inflation, convection, density inversions, and, possibly to, pulsations. We find that all models with luminosities higher than 4 × 10<SUP>5</SUP>L<SUB>☉</SUB>, i.e. stars above ~40 M<SUB>☉</SUB> show inflation, with a radius increase of up to a factor of about 40. We find that the hot edge of the S Dor variability region coincides with a line beyond which our models are inflated by more than a factor of two, indicating a possible connection between S Dor variability and inflation. Furthermore, our coolest models show highly inflated envelopes with masses of up to several solar masses, and appear to be candidates for producing major luminous blue variable eruptions. <BR /> Conclusions: Our models show that the Eddington limit is expected to be reached in all stars above ~40 M<SUB>☉</SUB> in the LMC, even in lower mass stars in the Galaxy, or in close binaries or rapid rotators. While our results do not support the idea of a direct super-Eddington wind driven by continuum photons, the consequences of the Eddington limit in the form of inflation, pulsations and possibly eruptions may well give rise to a significant enhancement of the time averaged mass-loss rate. <P />Appendices are available in electronic form at <A href=\"http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201525945/olm\">http://www.aanda.org</A>",

		"abstract": "Nearly 150 years ago, the French astronomers Charles Wolf and Georges Rayet described stars with very conspicuous spectra that are dominated by bright and broad emission lines. Meanwhile termed Wolf-Rayet Stars after their discoverers, those objects turned out to represent important stages in the life of massive stars.\n\nAs the first conference in a long time that was specifically dedicated to Wolf-Rayet stars, an international workshop was held in Potsdam, Germany, from 1.-5. June 2015. About 100 participants, comprising most of the leading experts in the field as well as as many young scientists, gathered for one week of extensive scientific exchange and discussions. Considerable progress has been reported throughout, e.g. on finding  such stars, modeling and analyzing their spectra, understanding their evolutionary context, and studying their circumstellar nebulae. While some major questions regarding Wolf-Rayet stars still remain open 150 years after their discovery, it is clear today that these objects are not just interesting stars as such, but also keystones in the evolution of galaxies.\n\nThese proceedings summarize the talks and posters presented at the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet workshop. Moreover, they also include the questions, comments, and discussions emerging after each talk, thereby giving a rare overview not only about the research, but also about the current debates and unknowns in the field. The Scientific Organizing Committee (SOC) included Alceste Bonanos (Athens), Paul Crowther (Sheffield), John Eldridge (Auckland), Wolf-Rainer Hamann (Potsdam, Chair), John Hillier (Pittsburgh), Claus Leitherer (Baltimore), Philip Massey (Flagstaff), George Meynet (Geneva), Tony Moffat (Montreal), Nicole St-Louis (Montreal), and Dany Vanbeveren (Brussels).",

Most of the brightest stars are either also sources of nonthermal radio radiation, in which case the measurements interpreted as Compton scattering of photospheric radiation by relativistic electrons imply surface magnetic fields of up to a few hundred Gauss, or massive binary systems where the X-rays could come from colliding winds. The single stars and many of the stars that have been proposed as low-mass binaries are geneally among the faintest objects and probably emit a lower proportion of their bolometric luminosities at X-ray frequencies than OB stars of similar absolute magnitude.",

		"abstract": "The interaction between the strong winds in stellar colliding-wind binary (CWB) systems produces two shock fronts, delimiting the wind-collision region (WCR). There, particles are expected to be accelerated mainly via diffusive shock acceleration. We investigate the injection and acceleration of protons in typical CWB systems by means of Monte Carlo simulations, with both a test-particle approach and a nonlinear method modeling a shock locally modified by the backreaction of the accelerated protons. We use magnetohydrodynamic simulations to determine the background plasma in the WCR and its vicinity. This allows us to consider particle acceleration at both shocks, on either side of the WCR, with a realistic large-scale magnetic field. We highlight the possible effects of particle acceleration on the local shock profiles at the WCR. We include the effect of magnetic field amplification, due to resonant-streaming instability, and compare results without and with the backreaction of the accelerated protons. In the latter case, we find a lower flux of the nonthermal proton population and a considerable magnetic field amplification. This would significantly increase the synchrotron losses of relativistic electrons accelerated in CWB systems, lowering the maximal energy they can reach and strongly reducing the inverse Compton fluxes. As a result, γ-rays from CWBs would be predominantly due to the decay of neutral pions produced in nucleon-nucleon collisions. This might provide a way to explain why, in the vast majority of cases, CWB systems have not been identified as γ-ray sources, although they emit synchrotron radiation.",

Relativistic protons and electrons are assumed to be accelerated through diﬀusive shock acceleration (DSA) at the global shocks bounding the wind-wind collision region. The non-linear eﬀects of the back-reaction due to the cosmic ray pressure on the particle acceleration process and the cooling of the non-thermal particles as they ﬂow downstream from the shocks are included. We explore how the non-thermal particle distribution and the keV−GeV emission changes with the stellar separation and the viewing angle of the system, and with the momentum ratio of the winds. We conﬁrm earlier ﬁndings that DSA is very eﬃcient when magnetic ﬁeld ampliﬁcation is not included, leading to signiﬁcantly modiﬁed shocks. We also ﬁnd that the non-thermal ﬂux scales with the binary separation in a complicated way and that the anisotropic inverse Compton emission shows only a moderate variation with viewing angle due to the spatial extent of the wind-wind collision.",

We compare our cooling rates to those in previous works, and implement the new cooling function in the grid-adaptive framework “AMRVAC”. Contributions to the cooling rate by the individual elements are given, to allow for the creation of cooling curves tailored to speciﬁc abundance requirements. In some situations, it is important to be able to include radiative losses in the hydrodynamics. The enhanced compression ratio can trigger instabilities (such as the Vishniac thin-shell instability) that would otherwise be absent. For gas with temperatures below 104 K, the cooling time becomes very long and does not aﬀect the gas on the timescales that are generally of interest for hydrodynamical simulations of circumstellar plasmas. However, above this temperature, a signiﬁcant fraction of the elements is ionised, and the cooling rate increases by a factor 1000 relative to lower temperature plasmas.",

This two-epoch imaging provides an expansion parallax and thus a practically assumption-free geometric distance to the nebula, d = 3.35 ± 0.67 kpc. Combined with the global velocity distribution in the ejected nebula, this confirms the extreme runaway status of WR 124. WR stars embedded within such ejection nebulae at the point of core collapse would produce different supernova characteristics from those expected for stars surrounded by wind-filled cavities. In galaxies with extremely low ambient metallicity, Z <= 10-3 Z sun, γ-ray bursts originating from fast-moving runaway WR stars may produce afterglows which appear to be coming from regions with a relatively homogeneous circumburst medium.",

		"abstract": "Hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs with metal lines, so-called DAZs, show evidence for ongoing accretion of material onto their surfaces. Some DAZs are known to have unresolved M dwarf companions, which could account for the observed accretion through a stellar wind. I combine observed Ca abundances of the DAZs with information on the orbital separation of their M dwarf companions to infer the mass-loss rate of the M dwarfs. I find that for three of the six known DAZs with M dwarf companions, a stellar wind can plausibly explain the observed accretion on the white dwarfs assuming Bondi-Hoyle accretion of solar abundance stellar winds on the order of 10-14 to 10-16 M☉ yr-1. The rest of the sample have companions with orbits ≳1 AU and require companion mass-loss rates of >10-11 M☉ yr-1. I conclude that there must be an alternative explanation for accretion of material onto DAZs with widely separated companions. The inferred winds for two of the close binaries are orders of magnitude smaller than typically assumed for the angular momentum loss of red dwarf-white dwarf pairs due to magnetic braking from a stellar wind and may seriously affect predictions for the formation rate of CVs with low-mass companions.",

		"abstract": "<i>Context. <i/>The principle definition of habitability for exoplanets is whether they can sustain liquid water on their surfaces, i.e. that they orbit within the habitable zone. However, the planet’s magnetosphere should also be considered, since without it, an exoplanet’s atmosphere may be eroded away by stellar winds.<i>Aims. <i/>The aim of this paper is to investigate magnetospheric protection of a planet from the effects of stellar winds from solar-mass stars.<i>Methods. <i/>We study hypothetical Earth-like exoplanets orbiting in the host star’s habitable zone for a sample of 124 solar-mass stars. These are targets that have been observed by the Bcool Collaboration. Using two wind models, we calculate the magnetospheric extent of each exoplanet. These wind models are computationally inexpensive and allow the community to quickly estimate the magnetospheric size of magnetised Earth-analogues orbiting cool stars.<i>Results. <i/>Most of the simulated planets in our sample can maintain a magnetosphere of ~5 Earth radii or larger. This suggests that magnetised Earth analogues in the habitable zones of solar analogues are able to protect their atmospheres and is in contrast to planets around young active M dwarfs. In general, we find that Earth-analogues around solar-type stars, of age 1.5 Gyr or older, can maintain at least a Paleoarchean Earth sized magnetosphere. Our results indicate that planets around 0.6–0.8 solar-mass stars on the low activity side of the Vaughan-Preston gap are the optimum observing targets for habitable Earth analogues.",

The line acceleration is calculated using a tabulation of atomic lines that is complete for the elements H-Zn. The acceleration is found to be remarkably constant over the temperature range 50,000-10,000 K but to drop off sharply for cooler stars. The anomalous ionization observed in OB stars decreases the acceleration by a factor of as much as 2 from radiative equilibrium values. More than half of the acceleration comes from lines whose frequencies overlap with those of neighboring lines at some point in the wind. Line blanketing of the continuum flux by the wind becomes significant for mass loss rates above 10 to the -6th solar mass/yr. The predicted and observed mass loss rates are in complete agreement for the OB stars, and it is concluded that radiation pressure is the dominant mechanism driving the winds from these stars.",

SSP methods preserve the strong stability properties—in any norm, seminorm or convex functional—of the spatial discretization coupled with ﬁrst order Euler time stepping. This paper describes the development of SSP methods and the connections between the timestep restrictions for strong stability preservation and contractivity. Numerical examples demonstrate that common linearly stable but not strong stability preserving time discretizations may lead to violation of important boundedness properties, whereas SSP methods guarantee the desired properties provided only that these properties are satisﬁed with forward Euler timestepping.

		"abstract": "In situ research of cometary chemistry began when measurements from the Giotto mission at Comet 1P/Halley revealed the presence of complex organics in the coma. New telescopes and space missions have provided detailed remote and in situ measurements of the composition of cometary volatiles. Recently, the Rosetta mission to Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko (67P) more than doubled the number of parent species and the number of isotopic ratios known for comets. Forty of the 71 parent species have also been detected in pre- and protostellar clouds. Most isotopic ratios are nonsolar. This diverse origin is in contrast to that of the Sun, which received its material from the bulk of the collapsing cloud. The xenon isotopic ratios measured in 67P can explain the long-standing question about the origin of terrestrial atmospheric xenon. These findings strengthen the notion that comets are indeed an important link between the ISM and today's solar system including life on Earth. ▪ Nonsolar isotopic ratios for species such as Xe, N, S, and Si point to a nonhomogenized protoplanetary disk from which comets received their material. ▪ The similarity of the organic inventories of comets and presolar and protostellar material makes it plausible that this material was accreted almost unaltered by comets from the presolar stage. ▪ Large variations in the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in water for comets indicate a large range in the protoplanetary disk from which comets formed. ▪ The amount of organics delivered by comets to Earth may be highly significant.",

Dynamical models suggest that icy bodies in the main cometary reservoirs (Kuiper Belt, Oort Cloud) formed in a range of environments in the protoplanetary disk, and (for the Oort Cloud) even in disks surrounding neighboring stars of the Sun's birth cluster. Photometric and spectroscopic surveys of more than 100 comets have enabled taxonomic groupings based on free radical species and on crystallinity of rocky grains. Since 1985, new surveys have provided emerging taxonomies based on the abundance ratios of primary volatiles. More than 20 primary chemical species are now detected in bright comets. Measurements of nuclear spin ratios (in water, ammonia, and methane) and of isotopic ratios (D/H in water and HCN; 14N/15N in CN and HCN) have provided critical insights on factors affecting formation of the primary species. The identification of an abundant product species (HNC) has provided clear evidence of chemical production in the inner coma. Parallel advances have occurred in astrochemistry of hot corinos, circumstellar disks, and dense cloud cores. In this review, we address the current state of cometary taxonomy and compare it with current astrochemical insights.",

		"abstract": "Exoplanetary science is on the verge of an unprecedented revolution. The thousands of exoplanets discovered over the past decade have most recently been supplemented by discoveries of potentially habitable planets around nearby low-mass stars. Currently, the field is rapidly progressing toward detailed spectroscopic observations to characterize the atmospheres of these planets. Various surveys from space and the ground are expected to detect numerous more exoplanets orbiting nearby stars that make the planets conducive for atmospheric characterization. The current state of this frontier of exoplanetary atmospheres may be summarized as follows. ▪ We have entered the era of comparative exoplanetology thanks to high-fidelity atmospheric observations now available for tens of exoplanets. ▪ Recent studies reveal a rich diversity of chemical compositions and atmospheric processes hitherto unseen in the Solar System. ▪ Elemental abundances of exoplanetary atmospheres place important constraints on exoplanetary formation and migration histories. ▪ Upcoming observational facilities promise to revolutionize exoplanetary spectroscopy down to rocky exoplanets. ▪ The detection of a biosignature in an exoplanetary atmosphere is conceivable over the next decade. In the present review, we discuss the modern and future landscape of this frontier area of exoplanetary atmospheres. We start with a brief review of the area, emphasising the key insights gained from different observationalmethods and theoretical studies. This is followed by an in-depth discussion of the state of the art, challenges, and future prospects in three forefront branches of the area.",

		"abstract": "We present results of an investigation aimed at characterizing the effects of oceanic impacts of 500m and 1km diameter asteroids on the lower and middle atmosphere, estimating ozone loss and potential danger from UV radiation at the Earth's surface. Little work has been done so far to assess the atmospheric perturbation from the impact of objects in this size range, even though their sizes are close to the threshold for causing global environmental effects. In particular, at the Earth's surface oceanic impacts are twice more likely to occur than land impacts. This work represents the first attempt at combining impact simulations with a three-dimensional shock physics code (SOVA), and atmospheric simulations using the general circulation model with interactive chemistry WACCM. SOVA simulations provided an estimate of the amount and state of material ejected into the atmosphere by the impacts. Estimated water vapor in the upper atmosphere was then introduced in the initial conditions for the WACCM simulations that modeled the subsequent perturbation of atmospheric chemistry Final estimates of the change over time in UV flux at the surface due to the impact-induced ozone change are then carried out using the TUV radiative transfer model. The results suggest that mid-latitude oceanic impacts of 1km asteroids can produce a significant, global perturbation of upper atmospheric chemistry, including multi-year global ozone depletion comparable to ozone hole records registered in the mid-1990s. Asteroids 500m in diameter cause limited perturbations of upper atmospheric chemistry with significant ozone depletion confined to the hemisphere in which the impact occurred. Impact-induced ozone depletion affects UV irradiance at the Earth's surface, resulting in levels of UV-B irradiance that can be dangerous for living organisms, and, in the tropics and initial midlatitude summers, far exceed levels currently experienced anywhere on Earth.",

		"abstract": "Determining the origin of volatiles on terrestrial planets and quantifying atmospheric loss during planet formation is crucial for understanding the history and evolution of planetary atmospheres. Using geochemical observations of noble gases and major volatiles we determine what the present day inventory of volatiles tells us about the sources, the accretion process and the early differentiation of the Earth. We further quantify the key volatile loss mechanisms and the atmospheric loss history during Earth’s formation. Volatiles were accreted throughout the Earth’s formation, but Earth’s early accretion history was volatile poor. Although nebular Ne and possible H in the deep mantle might be a fingerprint of this early accretion, most of the mantle does not remember this signature implying that volatile loss occurred during accretion. Present day geochemistry of volatiles shows no evidence of hydrodynamic escape as the isotopic compositions of most volatiles are chondritic. This suggests that atmospheric loss generated by impacts played a major role during Earth’s formation. While many of the volatiles have chondritic isotopic ratios, their relative abundances are certainly not chondritic again suggesting volatile loss tied to impacts. Geochemical evidence of atmospheric loss comes from the ${}^{3}\\mathrm{He}/{}^{22}\\mathrm{Ne}$, halogen ratios (e.g., F/Cl) and low H/N ratios. In addition, the geochemical ratios indicate that most of the water could have been delivered prior to the Moon forming impact and that the Moon forming impact did not drive off the ocean. Given the importance of impacts in determining the volatile budget of the Earth we examine the contributions to atmospheric loss from both small and large impacts. We find that atmospheric mass loss due to impacts can be characterized into three different regimes: 1) Giant Impacts, that create a strong shock transversing the whole planet and that can lead to atmospheric loss globally. 2) Large enough impactors ($m_{\\mathit{cap}} \\gtrsim \\sqrt{2} \\rho_{0} (\\pi h R)^{3/2}$, $r_{\\mathit{cap}}\\sim25~\\mbox{km}$for the current Earth), that are able to eject all the atmosphere above the tangent plane of the impact site, where $h$, $R$and $\\rho_{0}$are the atmospheric scale height, radius of the target, and its atmospheric density at the ground. 3) Small impactors ($m_{\\mathit{min}}>4 \\pi\\rho_{0} h^{3}$, $r_{\\mathit {min}}\\sim 1~\\mbox{km}$for the current Earth), that are only able to eject a fraction of the atmospheric mass above the tangent plane. We demonstrate that per unit impactor mass, small impactors with $r_{\\mathit{min}} < r < r_{\\mathit{cap}}$are the most efficient impactors in eroding the atmosphere. In fact for the current atmospheric mass of the Earth, they are more than five orders of magnitude more efficient (per unit impactor mass) than giant impacts, implying that atmospheric mass loss must have been common. The enormous atmospheric mass loss efficiency of small impactors is due to the fact that most of their impact energy and momentum is directly available for local mass loss, where as in the giant impact regime a lot of energy and momentum is ’wasted’ by having to create a strong shock that can transverse the entirety of the planet such that global atmospheric loss can be achieved. In the absence of any volatile delivery and outgassing, we show that the population of late impactors inferred from the lunar cratering record containing 0.1% $M_{\\oplus }$is able to erode the entire current Earth’s atmosphere implying that an interplay of erosion, outgassing and volatile delivery is likely responsible for determining the atmospheric mass and composition of the early Earth. Combining geochemical observations with impact models suggest an interesting synergy between small and big impacts, where giant impacts create large magma oceans and small and larger impacts drive the atmospheric loss.",

		"abstract": "The origin of terrestrial volatiles remains one of the most puzzling questions in planetary sciences. The timing and composition of chondritic and cometary deliveries to Earth has remained enigmatic due to the paucity of reliable measurements of cometary material. This work uses recently measured volatile elemental ratios and noble gas isotope data from comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P/C-G), in combination with chondritic data from the literature, to reconstruct the composition of Earth’s ancient atmosphere. Comets are found to have contributed ~20% of atmospheric heavy noble gases (i.e., Kr and Xe) but limited amounts of other volatile elements (water, halogens and likely organic materials) to Earth. These cometary noble gases were likely mixed with chondritic - and not solar - sources to form the atmosphere. We show that an ancient atmosphere composed of chondritic and cometary volatiles is more enriched in Xe relative to the modern atmosphere, requiring that 8–12 times the present-day inventory of Xe was lost to space. This potentially resolves the long-standing mystery of Earth’s “missing xenon”, with regards to both Xe elemental depletion and isotopic fractionation in the atmosphere. The inferred Kr/H2O and Xe/H2O of the initial atmosphere suggest that Earth’s surface volatiles might not have been fully delivered by the late accretion of volatile-rich carbonaceous chondrites. Instead, “dry” materials akin to enstatite chondrites potentially constituted a significant source of chondritic volatiles now residing on the Earth’s surface. We outline the working hypotheses, implications and limitations of this model in the last section of this contribution.",

		"abstract": "We report on the ﬁrst detection of a global change in the X-ray emitting properties of a wind–wind collision, thanks to XMM-Newton observations of the massive Small Magellenic Cloud (SMC) system HD 5980. While its light curve had remained unchanged between 2000 and 2005, the X-ray ﬂux has now increased by a factor of ∼2.5, and slightly hardened. The new observations also extend the observational coverage over the entire orbit, pinpointing the light-curve shape. It has not varied much despite the large overall brightening, and a tight correlation of ﬂuxes with orbital separation is found without any hysteresis effect. Moreover, the absence of eclipses and of absorption effects related to orientation suggests a large size for the X-ray emitting region. Simple analytical models of the wind–wind collision, considering the varying wind properties of the eruptive component in HD 5980, are able to reproduce the recent hardening and the ﬂux-separation relationship, at least qualitatively, but they predict a hardening at apastron and little change in mean ﬂux, contrary to observations. The brightness change could then possibly be related to a recently theorized phenomenon linked to the varying strength of thin-shell instabilities in shocked wind regions.",

		"abstract": "Methods. Three dimensional (3D) adaptive-mesh reﬁnement (AMR) simulations are presented that include radiative driving, gravity, optically-thin radiative cooling, and orbital motion. Simulations were performed with instantaneously accelerated and radiatively driven stellar winds. Radiative transfer calculations were performed on the simulation output to generate synthetic X-ray data, which are used to conduct a detailed comparison against observations.\nResults. When instantaneously accelerated stellar winds are adopted in the simulation, a stable wind-wind collision region (WCR) is established at all orbital phases. In contrast, when the stellar winds are radiatively driven, and thus the acceleration regions of the winds are accounted for, the WCR is far more unstable. As the stars approach periastron, the ram pressure of the WR’s wind overwhelms the O star’s and, following a signiﬁcant disruption of the shocks by non-linear thin-shell instabilities (NTSIs), the WCR collapses onto the O star. X-ray calculations reveal that when a stable WCR exists the models over-predict the observed X-ray ﬂux by more than two orders of magnitude. The collapse of the WCR onto the O star substantially reduces the discrepancy in the 2–10 keV ﬂux to a factor of 6 at φ = 0.994. However, the observed spectrum is not well matched by the models.\nConclusions. We conclude that the agreement between the models and observations could be improved by increasing the ratio of the mass-loss rates in favour of the WR star to the extent that a normal wind ram pressure balance does not occur at any orbital phase, potentially leading to a sustained collapse of the WCR onto the O star. Radiative braking may then play a signiﬁcant rôle for the WCR dynamics and resulting X-ray emission.",

		"abstract": "The archetypal Wolf-Rayet + O star colliding-wind binary WR 140 has a very elliptical orbit, so that maximum interaction between the WR and O winds, and the most rapid changes in conﬁguration, occur around periastron passage. To exploit this laboratory for studying wind-collision and high-energy phenomena, several groups mounted campaigns to observe WR 140 intensively around the most recent (2009) periastron passage. These included multi-site optical spectroscopy to reﬁne the radial velocity orbit and study anomalous emission from the shock-compressed wind, infrared spectroscopy to study related features and map the wind-collision region, high-resolution radio imaging of the wind-collision shock, and X-ray observations with RXTE, XMMNewton, Chandra and Suzaku to study physical conditions in the shocks. Some preliminary results from these campaigns will be surveyed and the synergy of multi-wavelength observations considered.",

		"abstract": "Wolf-Rayet stars of the carbon sequence (WC stars) are an important cornerstone in the late evolution of massive stars before their core collapse. As core-helium burning, hydrogen-free objects with huge mass-loss, they are likely the last observable stage before collapse and thus promising progenitor candidates for type Ib/c supernovae. Their strong mass-loss furthermore provides challenges and constraints to the theory of radiatively driven winds. Thus, the determination of the WC star parameters is of major importance for several astrophysical fields. With Gaia DR2, for the first time parallaxes for a large sample of Galactic WC stars are available, removing major uncertainties inherent to earlier studies. In this work, we re-examine a previously studied sample of WC stars to derive key properties of the Galactic WC population. All quantities depending on the distance are updated, while the underlying spectral analyzes remain untouched. Contrasting earlier assumptions, our study yields that WC stars of the same subtype can significantly vary in absolute magnitude. With Gaia DR2, the picture of the Galactic WC population becomes more complex: We obtain luminosities ranging from logL/L<SUB>⊙</SUB> = 4.9-6.0 with one outlier (WR 119) having logL/L<SUB>⊙</SUB> = 4.7. This indicates that the WC stars are likely formed from a broader initial mass range than previously assumed. We obtain mass-loss rates ranging between log Ṁ = -5.1 and -4.1, with Ṁ ∝ L<SUP>0.68</SUP> and a linear scaling of the modified wind momentum with luminosity. We discuss the implications for stellar evolution, including unsolved issues regarding the need of envelope inflation to address the WR radius problem, and the open questions in regard to the connection of WR stars with Gamma-ray bursts. WC and WO stars are progenitors of massive black holes, collapsing either silently or in a supernova that most-likely has to be preceded by a WO stage.",

		"abstract": "We present a quantitative classification scheme for carbon and oxygen sequence Wolf-Rayet stars. Our scheme uses new high-quality optical AAT and INT observations of 20 stars for which we provide narrow-band photometry and estimates of interstellar reddenings. In increasing order of excitation, our spectral classes range from WC11 to WC4 for Wolf-Rayet stars with a dominant carbon line visual spectrum, and subsequently from WO4 to WO1 for those with predominantly oxygen lines. We refine existing WC and WO schemes to incorporate stars with higher and lower excitation spectral features. Both massive stars and central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) can be classified with the unified system. We have found no criterion that cleanly separates spectra of the two types of star, including elemental abundances (C/O or C/He). However, CSPNe show a wider range of line strength and width than massive stars in the same ionization subclass. Systematically lower FWHM(Civ lambda5808) values are observed from WO-type CSPNe than from massive WO stars. For WC4-11 stars, our primary diagnostic is the equivalent width or line flux ratio Civ lambdalambda5801-12/Ciiilambda5696. We extend the use of this as the principal criterion throughout the WC sequence, with few reclassifications necessary relative to Smith, Shara & Moffat. For WO stars, Ciii is absent and our new criteria, using primarily oxygen lines, take over smoothly. We define subclasses WO4-1, using Ovi lambdalambda3811-34/Ov lambda5590 as our primary diagnostic. The continuation in spectral sequence from WC to WO is used to indicate that the sequence is a result primarily of excitation effects, rather than significant abundance differences. Our scheme allows us to confirm that massive stars and CSPNe are differently distributed over the subclasses. Around 3/5 of massive WC stars lie within the range WC5-8, while <=1/5 of CSPNe are found within these spectral types. Stars within both the highest (WO1) and lowest (WC10-11) excitation spectral classes are unique to CSPNe. A WC classification for the hot RCrB star V348 Sgr is excluded (previously [WC12]) since both Ciii lambda5696 and Civ lambda5808 are absent in its optical spectrum. Additional criteria allow us to distinguish between WC-type, `weak emission line' CSPNe, and O stars, allowing us to reclassify the central star of IRAS 21282+5050 (previously [WC11]) as an O star.",

		"abstract": "New terminal wind velocities for 164 Wolf-Rayet stars (from the Galaxy and LMC) based on PCyg profiles of lambda1550 CIV resonance line were derived from the archive high and low resolution IUE spectra available form the INES database. The high resolution data on 59 WR stars (39 from the Galaxy and 20 from LMC) were used to calibrate the empirical relation lambda_min^Abs- lambda_peak^Emis vs terminal wind velocity, which was then used for determinations of the terminal wind velocities from the low resolution IUE data. We almost doubled the previous most extended sample of such measurements. Our new measurements, based on high resolution data, are precise within 5-7%. Measurements, based on the low resolution spectra have the formal errors of approx 40-60%. A comparison of the present results with other determinations suggests higher precision of approx 20%. We found that the terminal wind velocities for the Galactic WC and WN stars correlate with the WR spectral subtype. We also found that the LMC WN stars have winds slower than their Galactic counterparts, up to two times in the case of the WNE stars. No influence of binarity on terminal wind velocities was found. Our extended set of measurements allowed us to test application of the radiation driven wind theory to the WR stars. We found that, contrary to OB stars, terminal wind velocities of the WR stars correlate only weakly with stellar temperature. We also note that the terminal to escape velocity ratio for the WR stars is relatively low: 2.55 pm 1.14 for the Galactic WN stars and 1.78 pm 0.70 for the Galactic WCs. This ratio decreases with temperature of WR stars, contrary to what is observed in the case of OB stars. The presented results show complex influence of chemical composition on the WR winds driving mechanism efficiency. Our kinematical data on WR winds suggest evolutionary sequence: WNL --> WNE --> WCE --> WCL.",
