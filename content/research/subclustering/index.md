Prior to my PhD, I undertook a Master's project with the aim of producing an automated sub-clustering algorithm for open and globular stellar clusters. This sub-clustering algorithm was written and tested on NGC 2264, an archetypal open cluster.

Another aim of this project was to attempt to map and sub-cluster based on the dynamical motions of stars. This project was undertaken prior to Gaia DR2, and as such, there was insufficient data to accomplish these aims.
