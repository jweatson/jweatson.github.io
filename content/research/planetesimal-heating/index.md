The frequency of Earth-like planets with enough water to host surface
oceans is currently poorly understood, as are the conditions leading to
their formation and how they can vary between stellar systems born from
the same star-forming region. Classical planet formation theory suggests
that planets form from reservoirs of material, the composition and water
content of which is determined by whether formation occurs outside the
protoplanetary disk snow line or not. In the inner Solar System, this
results in the formation of water-poor planetesimals, and eventually the
conglomeration of these into water-poor rocky planets. However, recent
findings from the fields of geochemistry and cosmochemistry suggest that
early planetesimal populations were originally accreted from water-rich
material (*[Schiller et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature25990); [Drazkowska et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2203.09759); [Perotti et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06317-9); [Grant et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1111/maps.14041)*), while the bulk water content of the resultant
planets is significantly depleted relative to their parent
planetesimals.

*This evidence presents two important questions: why did the inner rocky
planets not remain water-rich, and -- more broadly -- how many
water-rich planets are there in the galaxy?*

As our understanding of the early Solar System has grown over the last
few decades, it has become clear that decay heating from short-lived
radioisotopes (SLRs) has been the driving mechanism behind planetesimal
heating (*[Grimm and Mcsween 1989](https://doi.org/10.1016/0019-1035(89)90038-9); [Grimm and McSween 1993](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.259.5095.653)*). This heating
results in rapid devolatilization, a removal of volatiles such as
H<sub>2</sub>O within the planetesimal (*[Monteux et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11214-018-0473-x); [Lichtenberg et
al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-018-0688-5)*). SLR decay heating also drives important processes such as
thermal evolution and differentiation, but the melting, vaporization and
eventual out-gassing of volatiles such as H<sub>2</sub>O are of particular
interest, and drastically affect the final composition of the rocky
bodies of a planetary system. Based on observational evidence from decay
products found in calcium-aluminium-rich inclusions (CAIs), the
distribution of SLRs was approximately isotropic throughout the early
Solar System (*[Desch et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/ad5afa)*). SLR decay heating is a dominant
driving force behind the formation of water-poor worlds. Conversely, a
lack of this heating can help form water-rich ocean worlds. This
desiccation would be consistent within stellar systems, while providing
a key differentiating factor between planetary systems born in the same
star-forming region; as SLR enrichment can potentially vary
significantly between systems depending on the enrichment mechanism
(*[Lichtenberg et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stw1929)*).

While there has been significant research into constraining the
abundances of SLRs in the Solar System based on meteoritic samples, it
remains unclear whether the amount of enrichment is typical or anomalous
for stellar systems in our local galactic environment (*[Thrane et al. 2006](https://doi.org/10.1086/506910); [Tang and Dauphas 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2012.10.011); [Mishra et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2015.12.007); [Davis 2022](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-nucl-010722-074615)*). Minimum
threshold levels of enrichment can be established through galactic
chemical evolution in the case of some SLRs (*[Tang and Dauphas 2012](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2012.10.011)*), but
this cannot explain the level of enrichment in the Solar System. Stellar
cosmic ray spallation can also produce SLRs, though this would result in
an inhomogeneous SLR distribution in the Solar System -- which is not
observed (*[Huss et al. 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2009.01.039); [Trappitsch and Ciesla 2015](https://doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/805/1/5)*). Disk enrichment
can also potentially occur through proximal early-type stars, certain
isotopes such as <sup>26</sup>Al can be enriched through the continuous,
high-mass rate outflow of a Wolf-Rayet wind, with a more rapid
enrichment of other SLRs such as <sup>60</sup>Fe occurring as the star goes
supernova. However, highly proximal interaction between massive stars
and disks would disrupt the disk through shocks and photoevaporation,
hindering planetary formation. AGB stars can also form significant
quantities of certain SLRs such as <sup>26</sup>Al and <sup>60</sup>Fe in their
cores, and expel them in their dense, low-velocity winds. This
represents a less damaging enrichment mechanism than supernovae, though
these AGB stars must enter the star-forming region as "interlopers" --
the likelihood of which is currently poorly constrained (*[Zwart 2019](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201833974); [Parker and Schoettler 2023](https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/ace24a); [González-Santamaría et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202346330)*).

## Current work

Over the course of my postdoctoral project starting in 2022, I have been
studying the influence of various enrichment mechanisms on star-forming
regions -- as well as on the effect of SLRs on planetesimal evolution --
via simulation. I have found that through wind and supernova injection
models there is significant variance in SLR enrichment between stellar
disks in the same star-forming region, with a rare chance for a disk to
be enriched to a similar degree as the Solar System (*[Eatson et al. 2024a](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2410.17163)*).
I have also found that <sup>26</sup>Al is a more influential SLR
on planetesimal evolution than <sup>60</sup>Fe (*[Eatson et al. 2024b](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stae438)*). While Solar System levels of <sup>26</sup>Al can result
in significant desiccation, <sup>60</sup>Fe enrichment multiple orders of
magnitude greater than Solar System levels are required to achieve the
same effect. <sup>60</sup>Fe may be influential outside the confines of a
purely thermal devolatilization model which was used in these
simulations; a more complex chemical model would benefit from an
additional, longer-lasting heat source to prevent re-freezing.

The chief issue for determining where the Solar System stands in terms
of its population of water-poor worlds and previous SLR enrichment are
due to the difficulties of observation. In particular, determining the
level of enrichment for still-forming planetary systems represents an
enormous challenge, and as such no survey of any kind or size has been
performed. Whilst there is interest in the population statistics of
water-poor worlds in the Milky Way (and where the rocky planets of the
Solar System fall into this), the sample size of potential ocean worlds
is currently small (*[Cadieux et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/ad5afa)*), and not enough to draw any
adequate conclusions. Future large-scale exoplanet surveys such as those
produced by the PLATO space observatory are planned to produce a
statistical ensemble of exoplanetary radii. This would allow properties
such as bulk density and estimates of water fraction to be performed,
and potentially estimating water-poor planet populations shortly after
the conclusion of this project (*[Rauer et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10686-014-9383-4); [Lichtenberg et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41550-018-0688-5)*).
