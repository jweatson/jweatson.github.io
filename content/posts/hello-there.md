Here it is, a post either extremely interesting or extremely boring to the reader, depending on how they feel about cameras!

# Digital

## Current

- FujiFilm X-T5: *Still putting it through its paces, but God, what a camera! What a pain on my bank account!* ★★★★★
  - Fujinon XF 35mm f/1.4 R: _Easily the best lens in the system I've used!_ ★★★★★
  - Fujinon XF 56mm f/1.2 R: _Also stunning, but more situational_ ★★★★
  - Fujinon XF18-55mmF2.8-4 R LM: _The not-quite-kit lens, when a lightweight zoom is needed_ ★★★

## Ex-gear

Unfortunately I've been through a lot of camera systems in order to find _the one_, which has definitely been a huge drain on my wallet. But at least I know the grass isn't greener on the other side (without spending thousands of pounds!)

- Canon EOS 550D: _My first SLR, I still have it somewhere, but it's sadly consigned to a dusty corner of my office right now_ ★★★★
- Sony A6000: _Barely better than the 550D, a bit of a waste of money, why did I buy it new???_ ★
- Olympus OM-D E-M5 MKII: _I loved it, really nice to use, but image quality was a little bit lacking_ ★★★★
- Sony A7II: _Bought this by selling the Olympus, produces excellent images, but an absolute pain to use_ ★★
- FujiFilm X-T3: _Like its successor, an excellent camera, only sold so I could buy the successor!_ ★★★★★

# Film 

## Current

- Olympus XA2: _The slightly less complicated, scale focusing sibling of the XA, very fun to use!_ ★★★★
- Bronica SQ-A: _My absolute favourite camera to use, heavy as hell, loud as hell, but I've rarely been disappointed with an image from it!_ ★★★★★
  - 80mm Zenzanon: _One day I'll get another lens for the Bronica!_ ★★★★★
- Yashica 635: _For when I need a medium format that won't break my neck using it, or when it needs to be slightly expendable_ ★★★

## Ex-gear

- Pentax SP500: _An excellent camera, but sold along with its lenses to cover the costs of a new Fuji_ ★★★★
- Practika MTL-3: _Got it for a tenner, died a year later, a serviceable body when it did work_ ★★
- Olympus XA: _As much as I liked it, I just couldn't get a good shot out of it on the fly, too small and finnicky to use!_ ★★★
- Like, 3 or 4 Ricoh point and shoots sold at Boots: _They just kept breaking! Fun though!_ ★
