So, big move, I've arrived in Tucson to start work at the University of Arizona! It's a huge change over Yorkshire, enormous change in scene, pace, and (most obviously) weather.

I don't think I've been exposed to this much sun or this much rain for years, it's wild.

As the title says, these are the photos of the first month in Tucson, I haven't got a car yet, so it's just a case of walking around with a camera and hoping for the best! That'll change soon!
