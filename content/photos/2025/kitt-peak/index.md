Had a day trip to Kitt Peak as part of the [The Solar System in Context](http://noirlab.edu/science/events/websites/solar-system-in-context-2025) conference that I attended. Whilst the telescopes were incredible, the surrounding landscape was utterly, stunningly beautiful, it was an honour to be on Tohono Oâ€™odham land.
